EPISTOLARUM l. 14. 617

Nec vicina subest vinum praebere taberna

Quae possit tibi, nec meretrix tibicina, cujus

Ad strepitum salias terrae gravis: 01 tamen urges
J ampridem non tacta ligonibus arva bovemque
Disjunetum curas et strictis frondibus exples;
Addit opus pigro rivus, si decidit imber,

Multa mole docendus aprico parcere prato.

Nunc age quid nostrum concentum dividat audi.
Quem tenues decuere togae nitidique capilli,
Quem scis immunem Cinarae placuisse rapaci,
Quem bibulum liquidi media de luce Falerni,
Coena brevis juvat et prope rivum somnus in herba 3 ³5
Nec lusisse pudet sednon incidere ludum.
