HORATII FLAGGI

GARMEN XIX.

Glycera (l'lvripa) is one of llorsce's favourite nemer. Sheis set dorvn aethe Cinara of
C. iv. le. 21 (see ιι), but with what show of reason beyond their having the samenumber
of syllables, it is not easy ιο aee. We noed not take Horace too much et his word when
ha says that his days of love were over. Many ο young sentimeutelist has imegined this
and found himself mistaten as tho poet appears ιο have done. Those who chooseto insist
that Horace is confeedng on his own account that ‘⁴ the heyday of his blood was temed‚''
put this ode rather late, auc. 729 or 7³⁰· Others lind in the allusion ιο the Parthian
(v. 12) accedun ιο fix the date a few years later (734 οι 735) when the standards of
Crassus hed been recovered from that troublesome enemy. This important epoch ie ever
before the minda of one rection of the chronologists: “dies noctesque quidam veluti
spectris territilcogitassent de signis et captivis a. 7³4 a Parthis Augusto redditis‚’' says
Franke, whose acumen, however, 'while it has led him on the whole into amore consiatmt
end probable chronological scheme than Kirchner and othere, is not above being misled
by too much real for its own inventione. 1 should he no more dispossd rrith him to say
Horace wrote this ode while the Arnhian expedition (i. 29) vves pending, then with hie
adversaries thet he wrote it five or six years later. When or under what drurmstanoes
or to whom (if any body) be wrote, ve must be content ιο be ignorent. (See C. iv. l,
Introduction.)

put away for ever. 1 burn for Glycera purer than marble, end that mischievous fece

so dangerous to loolr upon. With all her strength bath Venus come upon me, and
