Tonsori Licino commiserit. Ο ego laevus,

Qui purgor bilem sub verni temporis horam 1

N on alius faceret meliora poemata. Verum

Nil tanti est. Ergo fungar vice cotis, acutum
Reddere qnae serrum valet exsors ipsa secandi3
Munus et officium nil scribens ipse docebo,

Unde parentur opes, quid alat formetque poetam ;
Quid deceat, quid non; quo virtus, quo ferat error.
Scribendi recte sapere est et principium et lons:
Rem tibi Socraticae poterunt ostendere chartae, 310
Verbaque provisam rem non invita sequentur.

Qui didicit patriae qnid debeat et quid amicis,

Quo sit amore parens, qno frater amandus et hospes,
Quod sit conscripti, qnod judicis officinm, qnae
Partes in bellum missi ducis, ille prolecto

Reddere personae scit convenientia cuique.
Respicere exemplar vitae morumque jubebo
