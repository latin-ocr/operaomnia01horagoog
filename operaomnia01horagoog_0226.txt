HORATII FLAGOI

Nec pestilentem sentiet Africum
Fecunda vitis nec sterilem seges
Robiginem aut dulces alumni
Pomit‘ero grave tempus anno.
Nam quae nivali pascitur Algido
Devota quercus inter et ilices
Aut crescit Albanis in herbis

Victima pontificum secures ⁴
Gervice tinget: te nihil attinet
Tentare multa caede bidentium
’ Parvos coronantem marino 15

Rore deos fragilique myrto. .
