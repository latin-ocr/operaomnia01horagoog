OARMEN XVIII.

There lms been preserved iu Athenseru, 1. p. 48⁰, s engle line 01 hleseus 01 vvhieh the
first verse 01 this ode is almost s litorel temutes The metreelso isthe seme. 'l'he
verse is os follows (44 Bergk): μηθὲν ἄλλο φυτεύσῃς πρόαρον δένδρεον ἀμπέλω.
Whether the rest 01 the ode is e trunslstion 01 vrhst follows iu the poem 01 Aleseus vve
heve no mesns 01 lmovving, but 1 think in ull prebebility itis e close sdsptstion. 11
vve vvere not put upon the right soent, ss l think vve ere, by tbe ebore fragment, vve
should suppose Homoe hsd eirieud Verus, vrho hed s vills st libus, sndvrho vrss making
s plantation there. Verus vves the oogoomen 01 his end Virgil's triend Qumtihus, vvhose
desthis lemented in C. xxiv. ot this book. But whether or no he is the person here
referred to, or (vvhiolr sppeers to Buttmann, eud I egres with blm, the bettsrvvey 01
putting it) whose neme is used for the purpose 01 giving spirIt to the ode, it is quite
impossible to sev. “ Sterilem ugrum hushs rimeris,” es Fronte judidously mys on
another equally impossible question. It hus been doubted whether Honos vrrote ‘Vere'
or ‘vere' in oonseqnenoe 01 e note vvhieh rppesrs in the tvvo Sohohssts, Amen end
Comus. Cruq.= ⁴⁴ susdet ut oum vernum oompetens tempus est nnllsm erbonem prius
quem vitem ponet,’' from vvhieh it hes been inferred thet they hsd ‘vere' iu their eopies.
Some confirmedon of this theory is derived from Virg. Georg. ii. sle, sq.s—

‘⁴ Optime vinetis sotio eum vere rubenti

Candide venit evis longis inviso oolubris.”
Which Estrd steten is quoted by Acron. Ido not find the quotation in my oopy. All
existing MSS. end editions heve ⁴ Vere! John offirmo thet this person is ‘houd dubie’

vite) ssydthe seme. Such boldness sppeers to me most irretionnl. 'l'he respectable
names 01 these soholsrs heve misled the writer 01 the orticle Verus ( '.) in Smith's Diet.
Biog„ vvho might brve eorreoted his judgment by reierdng to Erue, to vvhose vvork he
refers others.

Torrentius believes the person to be thet unfortunate Verus vvhose legions vere out

the seme person (C. in), who vves his junior hy stlesst helle century, his judgmentis
