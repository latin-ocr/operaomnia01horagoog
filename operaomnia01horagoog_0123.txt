This amusing ode represents s gentlemsn in love with his maid-serrentr s circurn-
stuuee oi sufficicntly common occurrence to wsrrsnt the supposition thet Horace msy
hsre bed one ol bis friends in view, snd thet the ‘ode is founded on lect. The nume
Xanthirs must be fictitious, snd Phoceus indicstes thst the person wrs olso supposed to
be s Phocion. It is nsusl to suppose thet “ Xsnthies Phoceus” represents two mures,

’ sud “sd Xanthiam Phoceunr” is the common inscription, ss if Phoceus were s Lstin

neme, which the second line proves itis not. Why Hor-sce, sssuming s Greek nsme ior
his resi or supposed friend, should slso mehe him s Phocisn, who esu pretend to tell?
“ Sey it wss his humour,” or there msy hure been s significsnee in it which hus passed
swsy, or never existed but ior the understsnding oi the person eddressed und perhsps s
lew intimate friends. Xsntbius was s nsme given to slaves, like Gets, Sosius, tre, ss in
the “ Frogs '' and other pluys oi Aristophanes.

The dcte oi the ode csnnot be munken. Horres was born mcc. 689, und he wrote
this ode when he wus just finishing his eighth lustro, which would be in December,
mue. 729.
