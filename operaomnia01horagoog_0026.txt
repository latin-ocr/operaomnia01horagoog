xx INTRODUOTION.

ceeded in his attempt to imitate the Greek Lyric poete. Their fire,
passion, sublimity, his language was incapable of expressing, even 11 his
mind could have conceived them. Their meires have lost their strength
in his hands, and have passed into a smooth monotony, which none but
an emasculated taste can admire when compared with the Greek ori-
ginale. Some may doubt whether the defect does 001110 in the lan·
gusge, and perhaps in some degree it does; but the later Sapphic Odes
are mors like the Greek in point 01 rhythm, and are so far an improve-
ment upon the earlier ones. Some 01 the more difficolt long metres
have been as successfully imitated as the langnage allowed, but many
have not been attempted.

Horace's religione opinions have been a good deal discussed. But he
does not appear at any time to have been very decided in his opinions.
He was upwards 01 forty when he declared 01 himself that he was like a
ship driven by a tempest, going this way or that, according as the wind
happened 10 set. He was now a rigid moralist, nowa materialist, now
aStoic, now an Epicurean, now a Cyrenaic. 'l'o judge him by his own
writings, he seems 10 have thought that the enjoyment of the present
hour was the end of man's life. He nowhere puts forward the happi-

, 0000 01 another world as the compensation for the inequalities 01 this,

nor does'he make any allusion 10 another state 01 existence stall,
except in the ordinary fabulous way. The certainty of death and the
uncertainty 01 life are only arguments with him for making the most 01
the pleasures we possess, but cll in the way 01 moderation, which is a
common-place much dwelt upon by Horace, as also is the possession and
use 01 riches. Once, if we are 10 take him 01 his word, he was startled by
a storm, and induced from an idler 10 become serious3 that is, 10 put
away the doctrines 01 Epicurus, sor what length 01 time we do 001 know.
But 01 systema be appears 10 have known 111110. Ηο ridiculos them all
in their turn.

After Maecenas had given him hia sarm, he lived there a good deal
and improved it at much expense. He had a liking for the country,
and has some beautilirl descriptione 01 11. Βο1 when in the country he
no doubt felt lonely, and missed the tables and society of his city friends.
He dined a good deal with rich peoplc, but his own fars at home was 01
the simplest kind. He desflbes his daily 1110 10 the city, when hs
happened to be disengaged, 10 the sirth Satira 01 the first book. His
health was indifferent, as before observed. His eyes 10 particular
troubled him. He speaks 01 himselias grey before his time. Suetonius
says he was short and fat, and he describes himself good humouredly
as afit sample 01 ahog from Epicurus‘ sty. Augustus rallies him on
his stature, in a letter 01 which part ia given in Suetonius' life 01
Horace.
