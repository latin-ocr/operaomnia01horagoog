324 HORATII FLAOOI

ARGUMENT.

Maecenas, why is it that uo man is oontentwith his own lot, hut every οιιο enries his
neighbour? The waury soldier enries the trader3 the tradoe ou the stormy deep
euriae the soldier; tho jurisoousult, impatient oi his esrly abent, euries the oountry·
man, who dragged up to town by ι law suit, envies the inhabitants oi the town. 'Ibero
is no and to the instanoes. Well, suppose soma god were to offer theru their wish,
und bid them change pluma—they would retusa it! What hinders the wrath oi heaven
irom visiting these murmurare, und the ears ol Jove being closed against thern for
erar? But to bs serious (though truth may ba told iniust), tiae toiling ploughman,
the cheating host, the soldier, the wenturous trader, pretend their only object is to
secure a provision turold age, like the ant provident oi the lutura·¹ But she retiret
when the winter eomes, aud enjoys har stom while uinta aud summer, dra, sword,
and waves obstruet not your pursuit oi uealth. Whatis the use ot uaamrewhich
you hide lile a coward in the ground? ‘⁴ Oh, but iiyou take lrom it you will soon
reduco it to nothing.'' Be it ⁸⁰3 but if you do not, what cherma has tha pile of ouiu?
ll you thresh thousands ol bushels oi oum, you oanuot eat more than ma. 'l'he slave
that oarries the breed ests no mora thau he who oanies none. Line within the bouuds
ol nature, and ι hundred aereaere us good as ι thousand. ‘⁴ But it is so pleasautto
tulta what you want irom ahuge heap !” Nay, 1 do not sea why my baslrets are not

- as good as your barus, ii 1 οιιι taire as much irom my storo ιι you from yours. You
might as well preter to draw ι cup oi water lrom tha swolleu Aufidus rather thau the
little stram by your sids; but so you may liud that your lisa is the penalty ol your
greediness, while another gets his water clear und keeps hia lite irum drowuiug. But
most meu think they never οιιι Ιιιιο enough. The more you have, say they, themora
you will bo thought ol. Now what is to be done with ι man ot this sort? You cau
only leave him in tha misery ho prelers3 ιι the miser at Athens, when the peopla
hissed him, said, ‘⁴ Norer mind3 1 look atmymoney-box when l get home, and applaud
ιιιιιιιὶι.η Tantalus ostches ιι the retraating wetere—why smila? Chaugo the name,
and the story belongs to you. Even thus you gloat orer your money as you would
gaze at ι lorely picture, but you dare not use it. What is tho uso of money? 'l'o

your neighbours, and all the town detest you. How should it be otherwise? You
preter your money ιο them. suppose you ware ιο bestow alittlo pains iu hosping

would it be all lost labour? iu short, οιιιο your getting: having more than enough,

but what does all this maan? sm 1 ιο be ι spandthrllt like some we know ?'’ Nay,
this isonly to bring opposite ιιιιοιιιοι into oompan'son: all things hara their limita,
on either side of which right οιιιιιοι ιιιιιᾱ. So 1 go back to what 1 began with-that
greedy meu ars alwsys dissutisiied, end envyiug otbers; aud iustalid oi oomparing
