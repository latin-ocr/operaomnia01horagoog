xviii INTRODUGTION.

· but there is, so much affinity between the Ars Poetica and the Epistle
to Augustus that Ibelieve they were written at no great interval 01
time. It seems from the Epistle to Florus that Horace at this time
had to 101111 the urgency 01 friends begging him to write, one in this
style aud another in that, and that he had no desire to gratify them and
10 sacrifice his own ease to a pursuit in which it is 011111 ho never took
any great delight. He was likely to bring to it less energy, aa 11111110
was drawing prematurely to aclose through inlimnities 0111101· contracted
01 aggravated during bis irrational campaigning with Brutus, his 1111011-
tude for which he appears afterwards to have been perfectly aware 01.
Ηο continued 10 apply himself to the study of moral philosophy till his
death, which took place, according to Eusebius, on the 27111 November,
110. 746, in the fifty-seventh year 01 bis age, and within a few days 01
111 completion. Maecenas died the sams year, also towards the close 01
11; a coincidence that has led some to 1111 notion that Horace hastened
his own death that he might not have the pain 01 surriving his patron.
According to Suetonius his death (which he places alter his fifty-aiath
year) was so sudden that he had not time to executa his will, which is
opposed to the notion 01 suicide. rho two friends were buried near
one another ‘¹ in extremis Esquiliis‚'’ in the forthest part 01 the 1110111- ·
liae, that 11 probably without the city walls, on the ground drainsd and
laid out in gardens by Maecenas.

The plan adopted in this Edition, 01 eommenting on each poem ina
separate Introduction, renders it unneeessary to say much in this place
· upon Horace’s style and character. The particular style in which his
principal strength lay will be always matter 01 0010100. My own is that
he is nowhere so great as in tho Odes, and that 01 thess his geniusis
best shown in the Odes that relate to public affairs or men, while in some
of the small occasional pisces, as the Ode to the Fountain 01 Bandusia,
that on the death 01 Quintilius, and others, much grace and feeling
are shown. Ioannot at all agree with those who think that amatory
verse-ariting was Horace’s strong point. With 1111 0101011001 his
compositione 01 this kind, however elegant they may be, appear frigid
and passionless‚ bearing the stamp 01 imitation, with unequivocal signs
01 art, and nono 01 nature. The crowd 01 mistresses that have been
gethered 101 him out 01 his poems is beyond belief3 and the laborious
folly that has tn'ed to classify his amours, and 10 follow chronologi-
cally the shifting of his affectione, I have had occasion 10 notice.
It proceeds upon on interpretation 01 the Odes which is foreign 10
their true character. Horace was neither more nor less licentious pro·
bably than most 01 his contemporaries, though his biographer charges
him with gross sensuality ; but, however this may be, that the woman
