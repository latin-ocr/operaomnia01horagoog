and perverted ingenuity. Orelli, who was not wanting in respect
for Bentley, says, “ conjecturae summi Gritici, etsi semper sagaces
et acutae, admodum raro a circumspecto Critico probari nunc
possunt ⁸.'' Nor do l think heis much more happy, in most in·
stances (especially in the Odes), in his choica ol readings than in
bis conjectures. He was always liable ιο he misled by want οι ear ⁶
and poetical teste, as well as by the excess ol' a prurient sagacity⁸
and an unbounded egotism. The textinthis editienwill belound ιο ’

reason is, l think, always given in the notes. He collated some
excellent MSS, especially three in the library at Reme, oi which
the oldest he places at the end os the eighth century or the he·

in these notes are the Vatioen and other Roman MSS. collated hy
Fea (1811); twenty-three MSS. in the Royal Library at Paris

thirteenth century3 and sundry others quoted witb or without
name by Lambinus (1577‘), Gruquius (1611⁴)‚ Torrentius (1608‘),
and Bentley (1711). Ol the last the most important are four
collated by Oruquius, and known as the Blandinian MSS. belonging
to the monks oi a Benedictine monastery in Flanders, and which
were very soon afterwards destroyed with the monastery by lire.
The oldest os these, which is appealed to aa a great authority, but
which was certainly more often wrong than right iu the instances
in which Oruquius quotes it, was said to be earlier than the ninth
century. On the margin of this MS. Gruquius found some old
notes, which, as he says, with infinite pains he deciphered, and he
