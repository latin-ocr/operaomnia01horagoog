INTRODUGTION. xxi

The life of Horace was written by Porphyrion, the Scholiaet fre·
quently referred to in these notes. He mentions that memoir himselfz
“Patre libertino natum esse Horatium et in narratione quam devita
ipsius habui ostendi ’³ (on S. i. 6. 41). This same Scholiast refers more
than once to books that ha'd been written on the persons mentioned by
Horace. A reference to Estre’s work spoken ofin the Preface will
show that a catalogue of these persons embraces nearly all the distin·
guished men of the day, with most of whom Horace was on friendly
terme.

The caesura usually falls at the end of the second foot. There are two
exceptione only in Horace, ii. 12. 25, and iv. 8. 17. The Greeks did
not follow this rule‚ and their lines were less monotonous in con·
sequence. 'llhe division of this metre by choriambico is against the
obviem rhythm. 0. iii. 30, iv. 8, belong to the same.

0. i. n-This metre takes its name from Sappho. It consiste of
atanaas of four verses each. The three first are alike, and consiet of
four trocheee, with a dactyl in the third place. Horace always snb·
stitntea a spondee for the second trocheo, with ono uncertain exception,
0. S. 70. The fourth verse consiste of a dactyl and spondes.

This is one of the commoneat mctree. It differs in Horace’s hands
from the Greek usage by the less frequent introduction of the trocheo
in the second place, and from the caesana usually falling aster the fifth
syllable. This arrangement takes away a good deal from the vigour of
the metre, a defect which Horace seems to have perceired when he
wrote the Carmen Seculare and the Sapphic Odes of the fourth book'. .
