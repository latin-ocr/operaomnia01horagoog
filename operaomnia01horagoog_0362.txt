332 HORATII FLAool

“ At si condoluit tentatum frigore corpus, eo
Aut alius casus lecto te adfixit, habes qui

Adsideat, fomenta paret, medicum roget ut te

Suscitet ao gnratis reddat carisque propinquis.''

Non uxor salvum te vult, non iilius3 omnes

Vicini oderunt, noti, pueri atque puellae.

Miraris quum tu argento post omnia ponas,

Si nemo praestet quem non merearis amorem?

An si cognatos, nullo natura labore

Quos tibi dat, retinere velis servareque amicos,

Infelix operam perdes? ut si quis asellum

ln Campo doceat parentem currere frenis.

Denique sit finis quaerendi, quumque habeas plus
Paupericm metuas minus et finire laborem

Incipias, parto quod evehas, ne facim quod

Ummidius quidam; non longa est fabula: dives 95
