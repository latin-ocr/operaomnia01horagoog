INTRODUOTION. xv

that time continued to be his patron and friend. There is nothing
more genuine in Horace’s writings than his expressions of affection ior
hie father audior Maecenas. His gratitudo to the latter never takes
the form of servility, his affection never savours of affectation, and his
familiarity never approaohes to impertineuce. He sees in Maecenas'
gilbs to himself only the genereus disposition of the girer, os which he
has no thought of taking undue adranteg03 his patronage he neither

. exaggerates nor undervalues3 sor his health he feels tenderly; his

danger he tries to share; aud his anxieties he does his best to soot-he.
It is erident that Maecenas valued his society and understood his
character.

At his house, probably, Horace became intimate with Pollio and the
many persons of consideration whose friendship he appears to hare
enjoyed. Through Maecenat also it is probable Horace was introduced
td Augustus, but when that happened is uncertain. Iu auo. 717
Maecenas was deputed by Augustus to meet M. Antonine at Brundi·
sium, and he took Horace with him on that Journey, os which a detailed

, account is giren in the fifth Satire of the first book. Horace appears

to have parted irom the rest of the company at Bnmdisium, and per·

y haps returned to Rome by Tarentum and Venusia. (See S. i. 6, lut).

Between this journey and auo. 722 Horace received from his friend

1 the present of a small estate in the ralley of the Digentia (Lieenza),

situated about thirty-four miles irem Rome, and fourteeu from Tibur, in

, the Sabine country. 0f this property he gives a description in his Epistle

to Quintius (i. 16), and he appears to harelived there a part of every year,
and to hare beeufcnd ol the place, which was very quiet and retired, being
four miles from the nearest town, Varia (Vico Varo), a municipium per-
haps, but not a place of any importance. During this interval he oon·
tinued to write Satires and'Epodes, but also, it appears to me probable,

’ some of the Odcs, which some years later he published, and etheis which

he did not publish. These compositione Ι hare no doubt were seen by
his friends, and were pretty well known before any of them were collected
for publication. It will be seen from the separate Introductions to the
several Satires of the first book that thereis not one which might not

ἶ hare been written by the year sno. 719, and in that year Franks

supposes the first book was published. It may hare been so, but
Frauhe's arguments are not conclusive. In s.u.o. 723 the battle of
Actium was fought, and in the prospect of Maecenas having a command
on that occasion, Horace wrote him a touching poem, which stands first

. in the book of Epodes. une ninth Epode was written immediately

after the victory, and there is no poem in the book of Hpodes which

need be placed later. Iagree therefore with Franke in thinking that
