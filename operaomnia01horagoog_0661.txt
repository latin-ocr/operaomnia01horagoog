ARGUMENT.

Seuere, you know horr to take oure oi yourselt, ιιι horr to ιοοιι ιιο greet people; still,
though it be but the blind leading ιιο blind, sse ii you αι get ι hiut er two hom your
good friend.

Ii you wieh ior sleep by night ιιι quiet by dsy go ιο qudet Ferentinum. Hsppiusss is not
eontined to the rich: he too does well who lires und dies in retirement. But it yon
would benefit your friends end yourselt', go οι ι poor to ιιο rich mun. ‘Ii Aristippus
oeuld leem ιο ιίιο upon herbs he would heve no mind ior the eompuny ot kings,' mid
Diogenes. ‘Ii my repr-over knew how to keep eompeny with kings, he would ιιτο
ιο mind ior herbs,' mid Aristippus. ⁴ It 1 plesse mysehi, you plene ιιο people. My
lineis better thunyours. Ipsy my duty to theking,snd1rids und teodothir expense.
Yon beg elme, ond ιο become lover then ιιο lowest, though you profess to went nothing
ιι nil! Nothing oeme umiss to Aristippus. He simed high, but m oontent trith whst
he hud3 bnt us ior the Cynio, 1 should like to know horr ι change ot life would here
suited him. The one οιπίοι himself well in the most αοπιοι ριιοοι in purple or in
rugo ς ιιο other ubhors fine clothes, ιιι will die οι oold ruther then wem sny bnt ιιι
old ubolis. Well, give it him hook, end let ιιο iool live. Vroton'es end triumphs ιιο
very fine things, no doubt ς ιιι ιο urin the ievour ot the grest is no mun merit. Itis
not every body who oen go ιο Corinth. Hs who is ιιιίι ιο shuil not sucoeed sits ιιι
does nothing. Iret him poss. But he who does snooeed, is not ιο ι man? Ney, it it
be nny where, here io the very thing ve ure looking ior. Τιο οιο shn'nlm fium the
burthen ιοοιιιο it is ιοο much ior him, the other takes iton his shouiden ond οιπίιι
it through. lt merit be not sn empty neme, surely ιο ιοοι ποι who leaves no stone
untumed in punning his merd.

They ιιο sey nothing in the greet meu's presenoe uhout their own povmty will get more
ιιιι they usk: there is ι great diderenoe between suntohing ιιι modesdy reeeiving.
