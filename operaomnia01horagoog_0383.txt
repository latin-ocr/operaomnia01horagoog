SATIRARUM I. 3.

Nobiscum vivit, multum demissus homo: illi
Tarde cognomen pingui mmus. Hic fugit omnes
Insidias nullique malo letus obdit apertum,

Cum genus hoc inter vitae versetur ubi acris
Invidia etque vigent ubi crimina, pro bene seno
Ae nou incauto fictum astutumque vocamus.
Simplicior quis et est, qualem me saepe libenter
Obtulerim tibi, Maecenas, ut forte legentem

Aut tacitum impelletquovis sermone molestus,
Communi sensu plane caret, inquimus. Eheu,
Quem temere in nosmet legem sancimus iniquam!
Nam vitiis nemo sine nescitur; optimus ille est
Qui minimis urgetur. Amicus dulcis ut aequum est
