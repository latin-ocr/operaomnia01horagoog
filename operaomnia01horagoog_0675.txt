EPISTOLARUM I. 19. 645

hare praised good wine ifhe hed not liked it; and ιι for father Itonion, ιι never began
to sing tili he was dreuched. Aa soon as ever 1 iaeued my edict that the Forum was
only fit for ιιι ιοιιι, ιιι that song was not for the ιιιιοιι, shaightway all our poeta
began to drink night and day. But what, shall a mon look stern aad go bare-footed
aud with scanty toga, like Cato, and theu think he trimitating Cato’s virtues? Iar-
bites broke his heartwith enryof'limagenea, aud tried in rain ιο be elegantand
eloquent as he.

(v. 17.) An example only ιο ιι followed in its defecta is sure ιο mislead3 and yet if 1 hy
any chance were to look pale, they would ali ιι taking commin ιο make them look ιο
too. The servile herd! how their fuss stirs my bile and mirth by turns.

(v. 21.) Iwas the first to head new ground, ond he who has confidenoe in himself may
always lead the swarm. 1 was the first ιο bring the iambic into buum, imitating the
measure but not the subjecta and heroe spirit of Archilochus, even ιι Aloeus aad
Sappho mingled his mensures but not ιιι temper with their own. 1 then was the first
ιο make him known ιο my countrymen; auditis my delight that the good read
and handle what 1 hare written. But why do any read me groedin ιι home and only
go ιιιοιι ιο ιιιιι mo? Because 1 do not coudescend ιο canvass the critioe and buy
their approbation. 'l'nis is what annoys ιιιιι. Αιιιι Ι say, “1 (are not that my
poor verses should be recited to mowded audiences ;'’ ‘⁸ Ohl you mook us,” say they,
“and ιιι keeping your fine things for ears divine; for of οοιιιι honey only οοιιιι
from your hive: you ιιι the only ιιι gentlemau, in your own eyes.” ·Iam afraid ιο
ιιιοιι, ιο Ionly say, “l dou't like your ground, ιιι hog a postponemeut of the
sport ;” for such oport only leads ιο wrath, ιιι wrath ιο fighting and bloodshed.
