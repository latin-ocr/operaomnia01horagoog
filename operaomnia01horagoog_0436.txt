HORATII FLAOOI

SATIRE VII.

Ido not think many persons will agree with Franks in his high 1111111111 of this
Satire, the best of its kind, 11 says, and yielding 1ο 1ο11 or eren preferable to all
others, in elegance of composition, suavity of diction, and dramatic power. He wishes
to prove that it was not the 1111111111 the Satires, as most commentatore suppose, some
jndging from the quality, others with more reason from 1111 subject of it. The suby'cst
is a disputa, travestied 1 think without much humour, between one of the officere on
Brutus' staff and a merchant of clazomeni (a town on 111 gnlf of Smyrna), arising it

, may be supposed out of some money transactione. Horace treats 111 matter much in

111 same wey aa the disputa got up bwween 111 two parasitos for 111 maumam ο1
Maecenas and 111 friends at Caudium (S. 1. sl, sqq.). He no doubt had 11111 reason
for disliking Rupilius, which the Scholiasta supply, whether with any sufficient authority
itis impossible to say. They tell us that this man’s native placa was Praeneste (which
may be gathered from 1. 28); that be was 1111111111 from that townby hisfellowcitiaens3
11111111 1111 sarred in Africa in the army ο1Δ11111 Varus, propraetor of Cn. Pompeins;
that he was received into favour by Julius Caesar and made Praetor3 that after esem·
death he was proscribed by the triumvirs and joined the army of Brutus. finally, tbat
he was diegust at Horace, a man of low birth, being made a military tribune, and con-
tinnally inanlted him, which indignities Horace retorted in this Satira. Persius, the Scho-
liasta say, was born 111 Greek father and a Roman mother. Beyond this, which may er
may not be true, we know nothing about him bnt what we gaiber frons tbis Satira, that
11 was a wealthy man and carried on a large business of some kind at Clawnrense.
Dillenbr. supposes he was employed aa contractor for 111 supply of corn in Brntns’ army,
1111111111111111111 with Rupilius arose out of tranmctions connected with this business,
on which, from his experienoe, be was employed by Persiuss for Dillcnb. aud others (sea
Spohn in Jahn's edition of Horace, ed. 2111, p. 257) identify 1111 hero of this Satira with
P. Rupilius Munsnis, the Roman ‘eques' aud ‘publicanus,' recommended by 011111) to
Crassipes the Quaestor of Bithynia (Ad Fam. 11119). ’11111 111ο1111 are hardly worth
mentioning in acase oi so much obscurity. Comm. Cruq. says Persius wasa ‘negotiator 'at
Clazomenae. But the ⁸ negotiatores’ (money-leaders) in 11111111 111 other provinces were
not natives (as Persius seems to have been), but Roman ‘equites' They were an important
class, who gave no little trouble to 111 governors (see Cic. ad Qu. Fr. l. i. ep. l, c. l),
and their commercial transactious in Asia particularly were on a large scale. The 11111111
arose when Brutus and his army were in Asia Minor, which was in amc. 711-712 (see
note on v. le). How soon afterwards 111 Satire was written it is impossible to sayt ¹10⁸
long, 1 think. 11 may have been made on the spot, and shown to those who would tind
most amusement in it, in the camp. I think this is more likely than that Horace should
have reverted 1ο such a subject after hissrrival at 111111, where the scena mast bave been
unknown or little known; when those who might have enjoyed the jokc were most of
them dead ο1 in exile, and his own feeling against Rupilius must have been forgotten in
111 scenas that he had since gone through. The poam is a mere fragment in 111 (1111111111
11]11 so admirably 1111111111 11 111 11111 satire; but in this there iano 1111111111 brought
out, none oi 111 happy tonches and traits of nature which there are found 11 every line.
Certainly no two poems could bear less evidence of being the work of the same mind,
and this may be taken aa some indication of 111 early composition of the present onst
bnt 1 rest more on tha circumstance that the point of the story would have been lost in a
great 11111111 any length of 1111111111 the event it refers 1ο. Perhaps we may infer 11111)
the abruptness of 111 conclusion that Horace intended when he began 1ο mh ⁸ W
poem, but found bis 1111111111 or bis time orbis spirit fail.
