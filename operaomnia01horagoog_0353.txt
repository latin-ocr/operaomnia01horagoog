SATIRE Ι.

'l'he proiessed purpose cl thlc Setire, cr thet rrith which Hcrsce seems to hsrc beno,
may bo gethered from the first two lines. Discunteut rrith the condition thst Provideuoe

confines himself to ouo solution ol it, und thet, it must be rumicen, nottho most ccm-

The chronologico extruet e dcte from the verses 114, 11⁵:

“ Ut, oum occantur sese effudero, qusdrigue
Addunt iu epotis, et frustru retiusmln mudeus
Fertur equis euripo, nequo cudit currus hsbcuus.”

These verses Hor-noeis suid to heve imltsted3 sud us this Georgio is supposed tc here
boen published s.u.o. 719, the Setire could not hore been written before thet your. But
