xxiv INTRODUOTION.

Ο. ii. 18.-This Ode stands alone. Themetra has its name hom
Hipponax of Ephesus. The first verse consiste of three mochoes, fol·
lowed by a single syllable, long or short:

-ul-vl-vlz

The second ol fiv'e troohees preceded by such a syllable:

:l-ol-vl-ol-ol--0

Ο. iii. la—This Ode is also unlilxe any other. It is usual to divide
it into leet called Ionio (u u , ,), of which the two first verses con-
tain four each, and the third two. Respecting this metro see Bentley’a
note. It would seem that Horace, imitating the subjectos an Ode of
Alcaeus (see Introduction), tried the metra also. The Greek, as usual,
has a much-finer effect than the imitation.

Ο. iv. a-nhis metro takes its name from Archilochus, and consisto
of an hexameter verse and the latter half os a pentameter. 'Ibero are ·
no other Odes in this measure.

Epod. i.-x.-'l'he first ten Epodes are in the same metre, consisting
os alternate trimeter and dimeter iambic verses. They admit spondeas
only in the unevcn places. An anapaest is once introduced in ii. 35.

Epod. xi.·—This is one of the variatione of the iambic introduced by
Archilochus. The first werse is a trimeter iambic. 'l'he second is ἀσυν-
άρτητος, consisting of the last half ol' a pentameter followed bya dimeter
iambic. This accounts for the short syllable in the middle of vv. 6, 10,
26, and the‘hiatns in vv. 14, 24. Bentley has a note on this matre
, which may be consulted.

Epod. xiii-This metre consiste of an hexameter verse, with one made
up, as Epod. xi, of a dimeter iambic and half a pentameter, the differ-
enco being that these parts are here reversed.

Epod. xia, xre-These are composed of an hexameter followed by a
dimeter iambic.

· Epod. xvi-This consiste of an hexameter verse, followed by a pure
1cm reverse.

Epod. xvii-This consiste entirely of trimeter iambic verses, being
the only Ode that does so.

nlo rule laid down by Meineolre, and adopted by many editors, which
affirma that the Odes that consist ol' single lines, or lines in alternate

measure, are to be dirided into stanaas of four remes, appears to me too
doubtful to be adopted.
