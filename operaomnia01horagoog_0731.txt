Institui 3 currente rota cur urceus exiti

Denique sit quidvis simplex dumtaxat et unum.
Maxima pars vatum, pater et juvenes patre digni,
Decipimur specie recti: brevis esse laboro,
Obscurus fio; sectantem lavia nervi

Deficiunt animique3 professus grandia turget3
Serpit humi tutus nimium timidusque procellne;
Qui vadare cupit rem prodigialiter unam,
Delphinum silvis appingit, fluctibus aprum.

In vitium ducit culpae fuga si caret arte.
Aemilium circa ludum faber unus et ungues
Exprimet et molles imitabitur aere capillos,
Infelix operis summa quia ponere totum

Nesciet. Hunc ego me, siquid componere curem,
Non magis esse velim quam naso vivere pravo,
Spectandum nigris oculis nigroque capillo.
Sumite materiam vestris qui scribitis aequam
Viribus et versate diu quid ferre recusent,

Quid valeant humeri. Oui lecta potenter erit res,
Nec facundia deseret hunc nec lucidus ordo.

Ordinis haec virtus erit et venus, aut ego fallor,
