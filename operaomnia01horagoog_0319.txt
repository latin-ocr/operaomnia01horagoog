EPODON LIBER, 5. 289

Maius parabo, maius infundam tibi
Fastidienti poculum,

Priusque eaelum sidet inlerius mari,
Tellure porrecta super,

Quam non amore sic meo flagres uti

Bitumen atris ignibus. —

Sub haee puer jam nen utente mollibus
Lenire verbis impias,

Sed dubius unde rumperet silentium es

Convertere humanam vieem;

Diris agam vos; dira detestatio
Nulla expiatur victima.

Quin ubi perire jussus exspiravere
Nocturnus occurram Furor
