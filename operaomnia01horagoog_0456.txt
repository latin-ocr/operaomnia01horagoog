msywritanagedy3 Verius boldepiosp Virgil bnoolios3 mysnength lies in that style
in which Varro and others hare failed, though 1 am not eqnal to Lucilius who invented
it. 1 hare no wish to rob him of the orown thetis hisdne.

But 1 said the flow of his verse was that of a muddy stream, osrrying with it more fanlts
than beauties. Well, do you never find a blot even in Homer, with ull your learning?
Did not Lucilius find feults indoctus and in Ennius? Why may not I inquire whethfl·
it was from the nature of his mind or of his subject that Lucilius wrote olnmsy verses,
such as sny one would write who thought more of quantity than quality, lile Cassius
whose books were burnt on his own funeral piis? Grant him all the wit and eloquenoe
yon plesse, yet if he hed lived till now he would hare corrected much that he wrote, aud
taken more peina than he did.

If you went to write well eorreot what you write, and look for the approval not of the
multitude but of the few. You are not smbin'ous sinely of your verses being hsolred
in obeap schools. lf you are 1 am not. 1 look for the appianae of better J'udges Διιι

loting friends be plessed and 1 want no more. Demetrius end 'ligellins may go and
whine to their pupils. And so, boy, let this be my valediction to them all.
