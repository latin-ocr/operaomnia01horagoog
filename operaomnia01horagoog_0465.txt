repeats, though hia editor changes ‘Vivahum' inte ‘rivalem’ Porphyrion writes,
“ Cornelius Alpinus Memnona hexametris renibus descripsit.’' From which notices
Cruquius has inferred that Horace alludcs to C. Cornelius Gallus, the intimate friend of
all Horace'a friends, and of virgil in particular (see Bc x.). Nc opinion can be more
improbable than thia. Out of the word ‘Vivalium' (evidently corrupt) in Acron's note,
Bentley has conjectured, with some appearance of probability, that M. Furius Bibaculus
is the person referred to. ,This poet, who was born at Cremona a.u.c. 652 (sea Clintcn
12. H. anban.),iamentioned with respect by Quintilian (x. l. 96), and classed with Catullus
and Horace as a snthist. But Quintilian also quotes (viii. 6. 17) with disapprobation the
verae of this same person imitated by Horace in S. ii. 5. 41, “Juppiter hibernas cana
nive conspuit Alpea.'' The affectation notioecl in this verse, and continued perhaps in
others that followed, may account for Burins's cognomen, given him probably by his oon·
temporariea generally and therefore sufficient for them tc recognize him by. Some think
he is so called from his birthplace, from which Acron calls him ‘ Gallum pettam? others
because he wrote a poem (πραγματεία the Scholiasta call it) on Caesar's Gallie war, from
which the above verseia taken. Bentley prefers the first of these three reasona and Iagree
