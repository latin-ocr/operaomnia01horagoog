with him. The epithet ⁴ turgidus' appliea to hia person, and ia explained by the descrip-
tion given of him in the above plaoe, “pingui tentus omeso.” He is said to heve murdered
Memnon, and itis generally said that this refers to a translation he is supposed to hare
made of the Aethiopis of Arcdnus, oue of the cyclic poete, in which Memnon wss one of
the principal heroes. Dacier suggests that he wrote a tragedy with this title, to whidr
notion the following lines give some probability. Horace says that huius, like some
rede artists,hadmadeafigureofllhenuawith aheadofclay,referringtotheatetuoeby
which the different river gods were represented, and to some description this poet had
given of the souroea of the Rhine, probably iu the above poem on the Gallie war. There
is a very different representation of Rhenus ou a medai of Drusus, in Oiselius' Tamarus,
Pl 24. 6, where he eppesrs as e majestis figure, recliuing with his lea um resting ou his
urn, and in his right hand a reed partly broken, which latter symbol appearato have boen
familiar to Ovid, for he writes, deser-ibing the triumph of liberius, an. lt (ex Pont. iii.

Dillenbr. says thia word ‘⁴ haud dubie reprehensionem continet ut simile verbum de·

have the same meaning thet I have given to ‘delingit’ or it would aignify disfigured,

he defends Frisius from the adverae judgmant of Caesellius Vindex, who pronounced hirn
affected, and said he had spoilt the iasa tongue by the invention of new words, of some
of which he gives specimens. 'l'he heading of the chapter melros thia Parius to be Aulus
mrim of Antium ς but as he was a poet held in high esoeem, und onewhom Vngil largely
ι imitsted (see Macrob. Satnrn. vi. 1), it has beau mamad that “ Furii Antistis,” in the
lemme to Gelliue' chapter, is a oonupt reading (Weichert, Poet lat. p. 35⁰ sqq.). What·
ever the merita of Pierius of Antium may have been, it is possible he may have used the
expressions Gellius quotes, snd they would aot be mora or worse blemishea than one
might find iu most poema of the same length (his Annds extended to upwards of eleven
booka); and 1 see no good resson for supposing lhrrirra Bibaculus to be meent. lt is
curicus however that one of the affectations sscibed to the poet Gellius refers to, ia
“quod terrem in lutum versem ‘lutesoere' dixerit.” lt Bibaculus were the author of
this expression we might imagine that it had atuclr to his name, end that Horace uses the
expression ‘luteum eaput’ as referring to this proverbial reproach. What else is known of
him will be found in his life in the Dict. Biog.; the author of which notice thinks Horace
might have shown more respect end forbearance toviath the aged Furius He ascibes
his ridicrle to various possible motives, principally perhaps to the circumstanoethat rarius
writings '⁸ were studed with insuite against the Caesara” (see Tacit. Ana. iv. 3⁴), aud
Catullus he thinks incurred Horece’s hostility for the sarae reason. But Catullus is only
once mentioned in Horace, and there no hostility ia shown towards him (see above v.
19, n). And if Furius ves so abusive in his attacks upon Augrrstm, Horace's patron end
friend, there would have been ao muse for surprise it he had handled him more severely
than he has done. But Augustus, like Julius Csesm passed over those sort of attacks
with contempt, and we need not nrppose lloraoe ves much influenoed by them ς though
we mey believe thet the opponente of the Caesars would be among the most prominent of
Horace’s detractura, to whom he is here replying.
