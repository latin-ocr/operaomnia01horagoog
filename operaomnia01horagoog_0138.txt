HORATH'FLAOOI

CARMEN XL

Τιο dete of this ode ιιι been much discussed. lf any argument could bs founded upon
the first line, it would naturally bs inferred thet the Cantabri and the scythim tribes were
in srms st the time it was written. lentulus’ expedition against the· tribes oi the Danube,
who hed invsded the Roman provinces ia supposed, as 1 hsve said before (C. s. 23, n.),
ιο have tuken place while Augustus wss in Spain. Supposing this to bs alluded ιο, ιιι
ιιιο of the ode vnsy bs considered settled within a year, thet is, it must hsve besu written
shout ιιι. 729ς ιιι Hcrsoe speslrs of his grey hairs (v. 15), which is conustent with
thst date, for he wss then forty. But the date of the expedition of Lentulus is uncertain
'l'he only authority on the subject is Florus (v. 12), who does not mention ιιι dste οι·
give sny clue ιο it (see C. iii. 8. lntrod.). Butafterall it is not necessary ιο suppose that
Horsce meent sny thing very definite by ιιιι coupling two distent and troublesome ene-
mies together„ 'l'he neme Scythisn was spplisd ιο a grest many psople, some cf whom
were continuslly giving trouble to the ιιοιιιιις ιιι ιι Ειιιέ says (p. ιιι) if Horace ιιι
said, ·

‘⁴ Quid bellicosus Parthus et Aethiops,
or,
“ Qud bellicosus Medus et Allobrox
Hirpino Quinti cogitet Alpibus
Divisus objectis,'’

the sense would heve besu just the ιιιιο, ιιι the purpose ci ιιι writer as well mawered,
thst being merely tc introduce s convivial ode. He ιιι prefixed to it s name we hear of
no where else, ιιι which has csussd s good deal of difficulty ιο ιοιοιιιι. There isuo
Hirpinus οι ιιοοιι but this one, belonging ιο ιιι Quintisn family or any other.
Whether this persen wss a neighbour of Horsce'a, and got his name from his Sabine
connexion (the Hirpini were a Sabine ponpis), or whether Horace gave some friend this
nume from some familiar whim unknown ιο us, is a mutter of doubt. lt hasbeen sssumed
thet this Quintius, and the ons ιο whom is addressed Epp. i. lt, arethe ιιιιιο. But the
letter sppeurs ιο have been younger thsu ιιι former, whom Horace addresses ιι if he
were a contemporary (v. lh). Cruquius would substitute ⁴ Crispine’ for ⁴ Hirpine! Τ.
Quintius Crispinus vves consul with Drusus ιιι. 745, audit ίιιιοιο probable that the
epistle sbove referred to ιιι sddressed ιο hiro than that this ode ιιι. Finally to suppose
with most of the commentatore that this Hirpinus, whoever he was, was s nervom puson
inclined tc look with nlarm on ιιι espect of sft'sirs, and especinlly sfraid of ι deaeent ol
the Scythicus upon Itsly‚ is as usual ιο mutale the charscter of the ode. 'l'hat ιιι dis-
turbsnces and designs of the distent tribes were troublesome ιο Rome and topics of con·
versation is enough to account for ιιιίι· introduction bere, without supposingthat Horace
or his friend attached more weight to them than other psople.

ARGUMENT.

Never mind whst distent ιιιίοιιι ιιι about, nor trouble thysslf for the mnu of life,
which wsnts but little: youth is going and age approsehing: the flowers aud the moon
are not alwsys bright= why worry tbyself for ever? Let us driuk under the shsde of
yonder tres. Miz wine, boy, and bring Lyde ιο sing to us.
