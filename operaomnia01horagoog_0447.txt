SATIRARUM I. 9.

SATIRE IX.

This Satira, which is jnstly popular ior ite humour and great dramatic power, has an
historicel velue as showing, undesignedly but more clemly than almost any description
could do, the character ol Horace. It puts the man betcre us as in a picture.

lle represents himacli as muniering alone and early on the Sacra Via, when aperson
he knew no more thau by name, a lorward coxcomb, comes ap familiarly and lalls into
conversation with him, ιο his great anuoyance, ior he wanted to be alone and knew the
icllcw’s character, which was probably notorious. Horace does his best to shake him off, '
but heis too amiable ιο eope with the effrontery oi his campanica, whose objectis to
get through Horace an introduction ιο Maecenas, with whom the poet must therefore
have been known to be on terma oi intimacy at the time this Satire was written. The
man's wulgerity and want oi tact are conspicuous throughout the scene, as 1 bave shown
in the notes3 while Horace exhibita in every part good brceding and an amuble temper3
and though he is tried to the utmost by reflectione on his patron and his friends, he is
incapable oi aaying a rude word, is taken oli bis guard continually, and is amusingly con·
scions ol his inferiority ιο the man oi insolence on his own ground. 'Ibe etl'ect oi this
picture is heightened by the introductiou towards the end ol the sceneos Fuscus Aristius,
au old iriendoi the poet, aud a man oi the world, who, lile Horace, understood cba-
racter, but had that sort oi moral courage aud promptitudo which his {mend wanted.
'l'hc readiness with which he tales up the J'olre and enters into llortce’s absurd position,
and the despair ιο which his descrtion reduces the poet, ars highly ludicrous.

Il proci were wanting that the characters of men and the ways oi tire world are little
affected by the lapse oi centuries, this Satire would afford it. I look upon it as the most
genial and characteristic ol all Horace'a productione. ll we wanted tc torm an estimate
oi the man, l do not think we could go tc any other part oi his works with more likeli·
hocd oi getting a correct one; and his powers as a moral satiust are, 1 conceive, ieeble
compared with his perception oi, and ability to describe, a scene ol dramatic humour like
this. li hebed leit us only this amusing poem ιο judge by, bis genius would have
ranked high, and the goodness oi hia nature would bave been ccknowledged byall. lile
our amiable poet Cowpsr, Horace appears as a satirist ol human liic and oi the vices ci
society; but both ene too gentle lor that rough work, and shine most in acenes oi
quaint humour and inoffensius fun. Aa respecta Horace at least, let any one read this

Satira and judge ior himself.
