SA'i'lRARUM Ι. 4.

ARGUMENT.

Grest πο the liberty wherewith those worthies ot the old comsdy set their merl upon
the rieious, sud them Lucilius hus copied3 s meu oi wit sud perception, bute hurih
versilier3 cudng less for the quality of his verses then the quentity3 full oi words und
run oi fsults, which hewse too lsry to avoid. As to your quantity, 1 cere notior thst;
end when Crispinus challenges me st greut odds to try which oi us usn write quiolsest‚
ldecline the invitation, end thanis heaven thot 1 em ο mun oi quiet tempemment und
few words. He moy gc ou puffiug sud blowing like ο peir ol bellows, but thetis not
m my wey.

(r. 21.) Fannius gets s testimoniei from his sdmhers, while no oue will reed whst 1 write
(end 1 um too nervous to reoite it in public), beceuse men do not like to heve their
fsults exposed, sud there ure few who ure not open to bieme. Teke euy meu out oi s
crowd, heis svericious or umbitious or Ιοοοοτοαο, or hs dotes upon tine pisto or fine
stutues3 οτ is running sbout the world to mulso his fortune. All such ere efrsid oi
verses like mine, end bete those who write them. ‘⁸ Tshecere oi him; he is dengemuss
ull he ceres for is to get up ο luugh ond smuse the old women end children et the
expense olbis friends.”

(v. 38.) Now let me ssy s word in reply. ln the first plsoe 1 do not profess to be s poet.
Sir ieet in ο verse which otherwise ie mere prose, this does not mske e poet, but
genius, inspiratiom sud sublime leuguege. And this hm led some to question whether
co'medy is poetry. seeing thet the lsnguege und idess ure cll those of common liic.
There ure your fsthers, for instunoe, scolding their sons, just rs γοα ταογ οοοτ every
doy; moreover you msy shudie the words us you plesse in true poetry without ulter-
iugthe sense, but thot is not the cese with Lucilius’ lsngmge und mine (you must reod
it us you would prose, or you mehe nonseuse of it).

(v. 63.) But this question 1 moy discuss elsewhere. My present purpose is to show thst
you here uo resson to be sfrsid oi this sort ct writing. 'lbere ατο your intormers who
go ebout sud ure the terror οί ull rogues: the honest mon mey despise them. But,
even supposing γοα ατο the rogus, 1 um no informer. 1 heve no desire to heve my
books thumbed by the vulger, or to resd them to uny but my friends, end thot only
when ptest There ατο αιοαγ 1 grant γοα who bewl their verses in the lorum end in
the public buths, but they ere mere bloclsheeds. ‘⁶ But wo know γοα love ω concy, und
do it with mulieious inteut.’' How cun you charge me with this? Nuy, the men who
sluuders his friend behind his beck, or iuils to defend him from the slsnder ol others,
who eims only st being called e wit, who invente fulsehoods und blsbs οοοτοω, thet mun
is s sooundrel; let erery honest citizen evoid him. lhsveosten been et tubis when one
of the compsny hus emused himself with breaking his wit upon the guests, not spering
the host himself when he gete werm3 now this mun you look upon es ο funny sehow,
while ior my innocent sutire Ι sm called mriignoot, mrcesdc, sud so lorth. When
your friend Petillios is mentioned γοα defend him ulter your own hebion, thetis, you
damn him with s sneer, the rerieet poison, which smil never be found, if 1 lmow
myself ut eil, in uny thing 1 mey write.

(v. 10³.) li Ι heve spoken s little too lreelyoi others 1 msy be perdoned on this ground:
my excellent iether elwuys tsught me by cremples. If he would heremo live ίτιααίίγ,
οο would ssy, ¹¹ Look et the misery to which our friend Albius’ sou snd Burrus heve
reduced themselves by their extruvugence.” When he would keep me from bed women,
“ Tuke Seotenm ior o werning.” ¹¹ See whst scuodel emeher to Trebonius.” “ Wiser
men moy teech you by precept snd theory, my cero shull be to wetch over your pree-
tioe till you ere oble to tuke cere ol yourseli.'’ If he would heve me do something thet
wer right, he would tolie one ol the judices sud sey, ¹¹ There is sn exemplo ior you. ”
