INTRODUCTION.

'Pras materiale for Horaco's life ars derived almost entirely born his own
worhs. A few additional faeta are got from ashort memoir attributed
to Suetonius.

He was born on the 8th December, nmo. 689 (ac. 66), at or near
Venusia² (Venosa), in the Apennines‚ on the borders of Iauoania and
