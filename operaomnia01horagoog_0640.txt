610 HORATII FLAOOI

Oum tu inter scabiem tantam et contagia lucri

Nil parvum sapias et adhuc sublimia cures: ra
Quae mare compescant causae quid temperet anuum,

Stellae sponte sua juseaene vagentur et errent,

Quid premat obscurum lunae, quid proferat orbem,

Quid velit et possit rerum concordia discors,

Empedocles en Stertinium deliret acumen.

Verum seu pisces seu porrum et caepe trucidas

Utere Pompeio Grospho, et ei quid petet ultro
