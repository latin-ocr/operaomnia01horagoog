HORATII FLAoor

OARMEN XVI.

Horace here dwslls on his fevourite theme-contentum end moderetiom—which he
isoble to innuite by the example of Meeoenss es well us his own. The ingenuity which
hes discovered the occasion thet gere rise to this ode will herdly throw sny new light on
the meaning of it, which is very plsin. Whethcr therefore Horuoe's friends hed urged
him to melre mors then he hed done oi his opportuuities with Meecenss for the purpose
of enrichiug himself or not msy very well remniu doubtful. 1 confess the ides would not
hsre occurred ιο me. Tuo lirench editors suppose itte be en ode of thenis to Meecenss
for the giu ostheim, which it certsinly is not3 sud one editor, J. F. Schmid, suspects
Horace meunt gently to hint to his petron thot he should be glad of en extension of his
liberulity‚ e species of εἰρωνεία which itis to he huped does not represent the principles
of the person who suggests this notion. There is no clue to the dete of the ode further
then thet it wss written ester Horace oumeintc possession of his furni.
