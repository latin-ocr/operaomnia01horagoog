HORATII FLAOOI

CARMEN XXXIII.

'l'he extern elegies properly attributed ιο Tibullus mention only two mistresses ol hle,
under the nomes oi Delio end Nemesis, und these ure the only two thut Ouid mentions ιιι
the beautiful elegy he wrote ou thet poet's desth (Amor. iii. 9. 31, 55, sqq.). Oi the
person he cells Delia he wss ensmoured during the ssrlier part oi his Πίος οι Nemees
during his luter yesrs. (He died between thirty sud lorty, sbout the ssme time ss Virgih)
Muoh hus been ιιιιιιοιι ιο prove thot the Glycers oi this ode stands ior Delin (see purti-
culsrly Spchn de A. Tibulli rite et curm. p. 50. 96, who believes thet Delie, Nemesis,
Glycera, Necesse-e nsme occuniug only in the third book, which 'libellus it is pretty
eertuiu did not write, were ull the seme women). Others hsve identified Glycera with
Nemesis, cn eccount oi the number sud quantity of the syllsbles being the seme, end the
epIthets Tibullus epplies ιο her, ‘sume' ‘monn’ ‘suere’ ‘durni which correspoud ιο
Hcrsce's ‘immitte' Dissen is certuiu thst Glycera is neither Delis nor Nemesis, but
snother mistress otherwise unknown. Orelli is oi the nme opinion, but sdds thet those
who thus attempt ιο settle ιο s uicety the loves oi Romsn gentlemen, sud pretend ιο
know more shout them thun they huve told us, only mente e smile among those who bure
lived long iu Frsnce or ltnly,—implyiug thot his countrymen were bsd judges ol the
amusements oi their more gsllnnt neighbours. lt is not even certain thut 'libullus wrote
the pitilul elegies Hcrsce speaks oi. Glycera is one ef Horsce’s lsroudte netues, und
csnnot be tehen ior s resi nume here or elsewhere. It occurs in ruutm (hlil. Glor. ii.
h. 26); sud Martini (xlv. 137). Whether the person hsd sny more reslitythun the neme
or the versesis 1 think doubtful. 'Ihet 'libullus wrote elegies, thot he wes not rsrely
eroseed iu lore, ond tbst hs wss on some occasion in s despondiug humour, ure ιιοιι
sufficient ιο torm eprobsble foundation ior this good-tempered little poem. Whoersr

Horace wss much sttoohed ιο Tibullus, who ιω e isroerte with his oouoempornries.

Come, Albius, dc not be drswling pitiful poetry upon Glycers, hemum she pretereo
younger msu to you. Pretty Lycoris loves Cyrus, Cyrus inclines to Pholoe, who
sdmires the vulger sinuer ss the she-gout loves the nott. Such ure Iore's diversione,
bringing opposites under the yole together. So it happened ιο ιοο-ι tendsr hesrt

Decentes elegos cur tibi junior
