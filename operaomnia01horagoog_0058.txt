28 HORATII FLAOOI

CARMEN IX.

This is a drinking-song ior the winter imitated from an ode of Alcaeus, oi which the
following fragment has been preserved in Athenaeus (31 Bergk):

tri plu ὸ Ζεὺς, ἐκ δ’ ὀρανῶ μέγας
χείμων, πεπάγασιν d' ὑδάτων ῥόαι

κάββαλλε τὸν χείρων ieri μὲν τεθεὶς
πῦρ, iv di κίρναις οἶνον ἀφειδέως
μέλιχρον, αὐτὰρ ἀμφὶ κόρσᾳ
petituros α’μφιτίθη γνόφαλλον.

'lhough the obvious fact that this ode is a close imitation oi a Greek writer, might well
lead us to believe that itis a mere'work ciart, some oi the chronologists have found it a
date each according to his own views. Dillenburger thinks it was written soon aster the
battle oi Philippi, when Horace's friends were apt to dwell on unpleasant topica and re·
quired to have their spirita kept up. Jani supposes it was written at the country-house
oi one Thaliarchus‚ not iar from Mount Soracte. Buttmann too thinis tiriais a proper
name, (though oi course finitione) in which 1 see no reason to agree with him.

ARGUMENT.

See Soracte stands out with snow, the woods are bending with their burthen, andthe
sharp iroet heth ironam the succure. Heap legs on the tire and draw your best
Sabine wine, serenata, and leave the rest to the gods, at whose bidding the tierce
winda are still and the woods have rest. Ask not what is to come3 enjoy the present
day: let the donce be aurs while we are young, the Campus Martius, the promenade,
the nightly assignation, and the coy girl that loves to be caught. ·
