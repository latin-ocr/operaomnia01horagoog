SATIRARUM ΙΙ. 7. 525

suumn vn.

The substsnoe ot this Setire Horuoe puts into the mouth oi his slnve Durus, giving
him liberty to express himself us he plesses on the duy ot the Setumolio, when much
lioenoe wss granted to'slsves in particular. Dorus tslrsr mvsnmge of the permission
given him to ubnse his moster, end to munt the rich with e sluvery (to their possions und
te the world) hurder und more stupid then his own. He olso tunnis Horuoe with his
instsbihty und wenkness oi purpose, which port ottho Setire uppeors to meto buthe
most noturul und emusing (see noto on v. 23). 'l'he rest oontuins u grest deul thetis
disugreesble end much thot is common-ploce. It msy perhaps represent tbe hsbit ot
tslking trnsh under the neme oi philosophy, which those vvho pretended to be ottho Stoic
school hsd established, und tho humour would be moro perceptible to u Romen ot the
duythou itis now. 'l'he commentators spenlr highly of its wit, but most ot them melre
little distinction, end pruine ull elike.

Thereis no nuce oi o dete in the Sotire, but some think it probuble thot es S. 3 wus
written ut one Seturnnlis, oud this moires mention of the sume fat-ivel, und touches like
the other upon Stoic doctrines, it vves perhops written s yeur nster the ubove. 1 do not
see uny force in this, nor does it uppear necessary to suppose the Sotire 'vves written et or
nour the Saturnalia. lust wey ot introducing the subject might hove suggested itseli ot
nny time ottho yeer.

ARGUMENT.

1 hove been long o hetener, 0 my muster, ond though 1 long to say s few words, l know
my position, ond om efreid.

Is thot Dorus?

Even so, Dans your indifferent good slave.

Well, it's the Suturnulio: you moy speuk.

'lhere ere some men vvho ure consistent in vioe, others who ore elwuys hovering between
right und wrong. There's Priscus, o msn who chsnges every honr from the top to the
plain mun, from the stotely to the humble, from the rulre to the philosopher, the very
type of mntubility. While Volenerius the gnmester, when he oould no longer hold the
dioc-box for the gout, hired e boy to do it ior him. But he in his consistency wes
better or then the other mun in his mecumtency.
