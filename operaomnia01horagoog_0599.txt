EPISTOLARUM 11.

EPISTLE IV.

Something hus hoen ssid shout Albius libulfus, the poet, iu the Introduction to C. i.
³³, which is eddreesed 10 him, ss this Epistle is. liorsoe writes to him (probshly 110111
Rome) st his pisce neus Pedum, s town of Iastium, 1101 fer from Praeneste, which Por-
phyrion writes did not exist in his dsy, und the site 01 which is supposed 10 be occupied
hythe modern town 'ngsrolu 'l'hero Tibullus hed s good estete, inherited from his
iether, which before his death he sppesrs 1)] some merus 10 here diminished (see S. 1. «f.
28, u). Thst it wer not 1)] his own ermengerus, end 11111 his losses must heve occurred
efter thisuEpistle wne written, we mey perhsps infer 110111. 7. 111 nllndes 1ο them in
1111110111 elegius (r. 19, sqq.):

“Vos qnoque, felicis quondam nnnc psupmis egri
Custodes, fertis munere 111111, 111111 ;”

und in lib. iv. 1, 181, sqq. there ure roms bitter lines on the mmo subject. But thet
these were written by Tibullus is 1101 probeb103 und if not, the lsngusge 01 the clegy
ebore quoted 11 not enough 10 prore 11111 the diminution of the property took plsoe nster
it eume into his possession. He night osll his estete ‘peuperem sgrum' by oompnrison,
sud he might still by Horsoe’s stundurd be rich. He ssys in v. 41:

‘⁴ Non ego divitius penum, frucmsque requiro
Quos tulit entique oondits messis ero.”

He 1111] therefore be supposed to 10111111 his estete with whet it vus in the times before
he cume to it, rather then with its esrlier oondition under himself. Nevertheless there
ure some who suppose 11111 1101110 wrote this Epistle 1ο console Tibullus, end 1ο chide
him 101 being melnnohuly, referring to 1. 12, which, us Orelli ruys, 0011111111 nothing more
then e generul desmiption 01 humen life. The description Horsoe gives 0111111101*
person is confirmed bysn old biogrsphy‚ which 01111 him “ eques 1101111111 insignis forms
cultuque eorporis observubilis.'' He lived chiefly on his estete in the quiet pursuits
Horsoe here supposes him 10 be engaged in3 but in s.u.o. 723, immediately efter the
bsttle of Aetium, he sooompnnied Mersella into Gsul und 1111 absent sbout s yesr, which .
ss fur ss we know oomprised ull his 101111 life, though Disseu hus endesroured 1ο show

11111 1ο1 ten years, from s.u.o. 712 10 722, he serred iu the srmy. Horuoe smoug other
bleesings ussigns him good heslth3 newertheless he died young. 11 sppeers 11111 while
meny dispmged Horeoe’s writings 'libullus judged them kiudly, sud the stl'ection the
two poete bore one 11011111 oennot be 1111111101. 'libullur wss probsbly ten or twelve
yeurs younger then llorere. Vsrious attempts here been mede 10 gire s dete 10 the
Epistle‚ but none ere 11111110101] 10 my mind Tibullus died the nme yeer with Vngil
(noo. 734), 01111],10011 efter. Ovid seems to imply thet he first orme into 1101101
when Augustus wss mede emperor, s.u.o. 727 (Trist. ii. 463, sq.), “legiturque Tibullus
Et pluoet et jem te principe notus erst.'’ And so the Epistle is plsoed between these
two detes. Any thing neorer osunot be urrived 11, und thir ir unoerteiu.
