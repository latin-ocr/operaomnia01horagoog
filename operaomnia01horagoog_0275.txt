ment observed iu the three first books, then in sll the odes of thoes books put together.
From thie end other internul evidence it hee been ergued thutthis ode is n lste oue, but Ι
think the arguments sre ineonclnsive. It is true thet Hortos sddresses Phyllis ue his lsst
love, but not, so fur ss Ι eun see, in the tone of e person now grown old, ne Buttmunn

obliged ιο eonfess thet he hed been inoonstsnt to others would only be the more vehe-
ment in professing stedfsetness to her whom he derhsd for the oooseion to win. But Ι
do not mesu to express sny deeided opinion oue wsy or the other. Itis only importent ,
ιο beer in mind thutthis book was published, not ιο rerire Horeoe’s reputetion ss s writer
of ametoryversee, but et the desire of the emperor, who wished the preises of his stepsous
to be sent forth to the world, sud his owu with them. The ode ιο Lyde, ou the day of
the Neptunalia (C. iii. 28), islike this sud hes more spirit. It is not impossible Herses
msy hers written this es enrly ns the other, but thought the other better, end thet one of
the kind wne enough for publiestion. The form ‘epergier‚' which occure no where else
in the odes, gives this the sppeersuoe of s different stylo of composition from others; but
whether this is due ιο desigu or oerelessness, or to its being sn early or lete productior,
oeunot be determined. Itis not nt ell unlikely, ss some commentator hss supposed, thet
the ode wes seut ιο Maeeenss on his birthdsy, end wss only thrown into the ¹form of en

ι sddress to Phyllis for poetionl convenienoe.
