PREFAOE. xi

Ι meent ei first to give an Index oi the principe! words to serm
a Concordence et the end of the Volume; but 1 found there was no
room sor it, and Ι hope that, as l heve made the Index w the
notes pretty copious, and have given a full Index os Proper Names

expressed or referred to in the text, the want oi the other Index
will not be much felt.

I had hoped ie would be possible to give engrrringe os e few
coins, medela, vaeee, irc„ to illustrate various allusione3 but the
Publiehers are anxious to keep the price of the work ae moderate
as they can, and the engrevings have therefore been omitted.
