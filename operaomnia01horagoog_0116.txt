CARMINUM

LIBER SECUNDUS.

GARMEN I.
nuc. trs-25.

Ponnro retired from public affairs, in which he had taken an active part tor twenty years,
aster the triumph he obtained for his victory over the Parthini, sn lllyrian people‚ s.n.c.
715 (v. 16), and betoolr himself to literature, bnt confined himself at first chiefly to dra·
matie writing. lt appears iram Suetonius (de illust. Gram. c. ¹⁰l that he did not nndsrtake
his history till aster tha death oi Subest, nuc. 720 (see clintes, F. H. a 39 nc), for
it was after that event that he became acquainted with the grammarian Atteins, who tur·
nlshed him with rules for composition. Audit the history was not begua till that year,
even though (ss ia probabis) Pollio should have talen notes oi most ot the maeticha
be had te relate, with a great many ot which he had been personahy connected, it is not
probabis that so large s work, consisting oi mentesa books, and tetingin the whole
period trem the first triumvirate to the conclusion ot the civil wara, could have been so
iar eompleted ss to be communicatori to his friends bosora the year a.u.c. 723, which was
the year ai the battle ot Actium. But the words “ arma nondum expiatis uncta cruoribus ”
(v. 4, sap), coupled with “ cni dabit partes malus expiandi luppiter '¹ (C. i. 2. 29, οφ),
mele it likely that these two odas were written about the nme time; thatisto say,
shortly atter the battle aad before Augustus bsd established his gosemmant in the con·
tidenoa of the pecple. Itis true Lambinus and some oi the older commentatam were ci
opinion that the history ai Pollio is not meant, bnt only his hagedies, which they say
related te the events of the timae, aad which Horace wishes him to lay aside tor a while
aad give his attention to public affairs, until the republic should be settled. So they in·
terpret
——“ mos ubi publicas
Res ordinaris grmde munus
Cecropio repetes cothurno.”

But there is no reason to suppose any of Pollio's nngediss bsd referenee to the events ot
the day, while his history related to nothing else. 'Ibe Schohasts understood the history
to be referred to (see note on v. 1⁰).
