188 HORATII FLAOOI

dreemt of nny thing ol the sort, else they would not bere iuiled to eurieh' their literury
histories, in which they eurefully stick in every nume they oen piel up, with tbnt ol this
Telephus. But it looks rutber ill thet this well-bred leurned Greek, who lived on such
intimate terme with Horsoe, is never heurd ol in eny other pleoe. The beet informetion
ebout him muy be gleened from the other two odes. Telephus is u poetieul neme which
Horuoe uses when it suits his purpose, se bere, sor instunoe, rhen he wanted euch un one
to give en eir of individnulity to en ode beginning with the humorous reprool, ‘You tell
us u greet deul ebout tbe reoe oi Codrus und ot Aeenus, und ebout the 'lbojun Wer, but en
ιο hor, where, und on whnt we ure ιο dine todey, you don't sey e word.’” This is Butt-
munn’s opinion, und l think eny seuniblo men whb reflecte on tbe subject, without pre-
oonoeptions of reulity in bie mind, will agree with him. At eny rete e very slight ground-
worl of truth would be enough for the pert thet Telephus beers in this ode, end ou such
questione conjecture und time ure thrown ewey. Os the dete we oen only eny it ves
written before une. 732, for the reasons stated C. ii. 10. The seesou wne winter (v. 8),
und the dny irus the first ol the month (probably os the your).

Dillenbr. supposes the ode to heve erisen out ol the following soene. On u oold dull
winter erening Honos is sitting in e roem ritb some friends. They ure tulling end
drinking without much spirit, till ιιι nst the dnlnese of the eonversetion turning upon dry
points of history, through the prosy peduntry ol some oue ol the perty, Horeoe oen beer
it no longer, und burste out with tbe contemptuous lengnuge with which the ode begins;
then cells his diendo to drink, und sets them the exemplo. lt is eusy ιο edepl euch e
soene to uo οιος nus uem en ne non doubt, 1 tum, euthemon enen Hom
bestowed more tbnn everege peine, though thero leno ode in which the “ers oelere urtem”
inmore oonspiouous. It is impossible to suppose it the work ol e moment, es Dillenbr.'s
very nent uduptetion would require ns ιο suppose. He thinks the ode is one of tho eerly
ones, ss more skin ιο the lire ol youth thm the sobriety ol luter lile, to which remark 1

attach no importunee.
