EPISTLE v11.

0n some occasion Horsce, heving gone luto the country for mongo of sir on sccount
of his heslth, ut the beginning of August, ποι tempted tc stsy svsy the whole month3 end
ss ho hsd promised Msecsnss ιο return in n ferr dsys, he hed perhaps got s letter from
his friend reminding him of thet promise, sud begging him ιο conse beck. Μοοοοοοο ποι
s valetudinarius, end hsd probably some of the querolous selfishness thet ususlly sttends
on thul condition. We muy infer es much from thet ode (ii. 17), which begins “ Gur me
querelis ersnimss tuis ?” sud he very likely felt the went of Horsco's society et this
time. We cen only guther the tone of his letter or messegc from the chuncterof Horsce's
reply. Ηο ssys he hss uo mind tc riske return cf his sickness by going beck during
the sutumn ιο Rcmc; indeed thnt he meent ιο be sbsent st some worm plsce cn the
com through thc winton thet he wss no longer ss young end chemful se he hed been3
thot ιο was sure Meecenss' liberulity που bestowed upon him in s generous spirit, sud
thet he did not mesu to compromise his independence; for if ιο could suppose such ποι
the cnse, ιο would give up every thing he hsd ever received rather then forfeit his liberty.
He illustratet his position by two stories,-one thet of the fox who got into sressel cf
corn end grew sc fst there thet he could not gut out egsin (which Horsce vus determined
tc prove ves not his cese), und tho other s splenetic trich plnyed by la. Philippus upon s
worthy men whom ιο seduccd into lesving his home end vocstion end οοιιιιος cn s farm
in the country, the result of which unnsturel change wss the tctcl destruction of his
pesce snd independence. To this too Horsce means ιο ssy he vill never let himself be
brought. ’

There is nothing disrespectful or sngry in the Epistle, though ιι might eppesr from s
here outline like the above, or from ο superficisl reading, thet there uss. It wne written
ester meny yeers of intimacy, end shows pretty clearly the intinence Horsce hsd scquired
with his pstron; for though Hornce ποι not perhsps of e servile disposififfl. ²³ fflffiil
wss then rechoned, he would not heve taken this toneif he hsd not been sure Msecenss
would not felte offence st it.
