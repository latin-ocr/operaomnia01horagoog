eloquence (v. 23); that person was busy in making money, and so was this. But who
this Torquatus was we have no means oi dcciding. iletre? (l’rosop. Hor. p. 497) suggests
that it may hare been Aulus Torquatus mentioned by Nepos in his Lilc oi Atticus (c. ll),
as haring been with the army of Brutus and Cassius at Philippi. This would gire him
an acquaintance with Horace, which may have ripsned into friendship. Iu Smith's Dict.
