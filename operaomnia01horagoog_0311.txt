EPODON LIBER, 4. 281

CARMEN IV.

All the positive information we can derive from this ode in respect ιο its purport and
data is, that it contains a vehemeut invective against some person of low birth and oon-
temptible character, who gave himself aira and dhgnated the pcople of Rome: he was
alsoa military tribune. The approximate time is fixed by the last lines, which show that
lt was written while Angustus was preparing or carrying on war against Sextus Pom-
peius, who bad culisted in his service pirates and slaves, as we leura from Dion and the
other historiam. (See below, ix. lo.) Το bring us nearer to the exact date, it has been
argued (first by Messon in hie life of Horace) that, inasmuch as in the second expedition
of Caesar against Sex. Pompeius there were anlhted in his fleat a grain body of slaves, it
is not probable that Horace would have used lauguage of contempt which would apply es
much to Augustus’ as the encmy's force. lt must therefore bave been written, if this
assumption has any weight, before that arnrament vas formed, which was nuc. 717. In
716 there deserted to Αοςοοιοο, Pompeius' lieutenaut Menas or Menodorns (C. iii. lo.
15. n), aad itwas in consequence of the advantage gained by this man’s defection that
Augustus declared war against Pompeius, in which war he smtained two severe defeats3
after which he suspended operatione for a twelvemonth, and during that period it is said
with contidencethis lipode was written. lt is also stated by all the Scholiasta that Meum
isthe subJect of this lampeon. The greater number of modern critica doubt their accuracy,
and the name ‘Vedius Rufus' occurring in one or two inscriptions that name hae been
tired upon instead of Menae', though no attempt is made to identify him with any histo-
rical character. 'l'he objections raised ιο Menas being the person alluded to are: l. That
Horace would not have failed ιο οοιίοο the treachery aa well as the pride of this person.
But that argument, which is Gesncr's, has no great force. Horace meant to attack the
swaggering aira cf the man, which were more offensive ιο the citizens ιιιοιι his betrayal of

, Pompeius, by which they had gained and which could not have been noticed without

offending Augustus. 2. That Menas hed been so abcrt a time in Rome that he could not
hare been possessed of large lauded property, and having charge of the tleet would have
bad no opportunity of making himself uupopnlar in the manner here described. But no
length of time was wanted for these objecta. He had no doubt made himself rich before
be betrayed his trust, having hed plenty of opportunities for doing so, and probably he
did not seli bis conscience and his huet for nothing. lle had had time to invest hie
money, become a favoured guest of Augustus, and have his head turned3 and a very few
exhibitione of himself in the character here described would be enough to call forth thie
short lampeon. 3. 'lhat Menas was not an eques. But he was elevated to that rank by
Angustus, as we learn from Dion (xlviii. 45); and at any rate, if he had bnt the regidated
income of en eques, be had the privileges of that order at least as regards a scat in the
theatra. 4. Itis affirmed that Menas could notbecailed a ‘tribunus militum,' inasmuch as
he who hadbeen under Pompeius the governor of two large islanda (Sardinia and Corsica),
ae well as admiral of his ticet and commender of three legions, would have held a higber-
post under Angustus, who had received and continued ιο treet him with great respect.
But it is a matter of history that Menas' desertion of Augustus and return ιο hia old
master arose cut of his discontent with the rank ςίιοιι him by the former, and it ia hard
ιο say what that rank may at any given time bave been. lt was always subcrdinate; and,
though we leam he ,roae to be legatus to Calvisius Sabinam the chief admiral, be may at
first only have been a military tribune, which post however would at onoe gire him eques-
trian rank ex officio (ece S. i. 6. 25, n). 5. lt is said we do not know that Menas ever
was flogged; but that he was once a slave (he was a freedman of Pompeius Magnus) was
enough to give riae ιο such an assertion in a satire of this kind, whether it was known to
be ιιοο οι ιιοι. Thus I do not think there is sufficient intercal evidence ιο impugn the
