O. i. o.—rhis metre consiste oi three Asclepiadem verm, such as
Ο. 1, and a Glyconean‚ as in Ο. 8. Incuruas and 36 a trocheo
occure in the first foot (see note). The other Odes are i. 24, 383 ii.
12; iii.10‚ 16; iv. 5,12.

Ο. 1. 'le-This measure takes its name from Alcman, the lyric poet of
Sparta. It consiste of two verses, of which the first is a complete hexa-
meter, and the second is made up oi the lour last leet of an hexameter.

To this belong G. i. 28, and Epod. xii.

0. i. 8.-There is no other Ode in this metre, which also consiste of
two verses. The first consiste oi a dactyl and two trocheee, or a trochee
and spondee‚ , υ υ Ι ,, υ Ι ,, 3. 'l'his takes ita name from Aristo·
phanes. rho second is a dimeter verse, of which the first half consiste
of two trocheea and a dactyl, with along syllable added, and the second
half ia the lirat reversed, thus:

-Ul-Ul-UVl-ll·UVl-Vl-C

Horace always has a spondeo in the second place.

Ο. 1. 9.-’111111 is the ordinary Alcaic metro, in which each stanna con-
siste of four verses. The two first are divided thus:

:l-ol-ol-uul-oc

though Horace usually substitutes a spondes for the second trochee,

the only exception being iii 5. 17. The caesura usually falls aiter the

fifth syllable, to which rule exceptione will be found in 0. i. lo. 21, 37. ·
5, 14η ii. 17. 21; iv. 14. 17. This caesura the Greeks did not obsecre.

The syllable which forms the basis, as it ia called, of the verse,is more

commonly long than short. It is usual to look upon the first partos

the verse as lambio. Ihave uo doubt it ir trochaic. The third veracia

also trachalo, consisting of a syllable (usually long) followedby four

trocheee, a spondee being substituted by Horace for the second trocheo.

une fourth verse consiste of two dactyle and two trochees. „

0. i. 11.-uhis is an Asclepiadean metre, rather peculinr. The diri·
sion to which we are guided by the ear seems to separate each verse into
three parts, as follows:

--l-oul-ll-wl-ll-oul-uv

unis classes it with the ἀσυνάρτητα. Those who resort to the diusion
by choriambico destroy the muna] rhythm. To this belong i. 18; ir.
10.
