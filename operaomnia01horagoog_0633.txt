EPISTLE XI.

This Epistle is uddreesed to one Bullatius, of whom we know nothing st ull. He was
travelling iu the Aegean and iu Asia Minor, and was absent longer than Horaoe wished,
or thought good for him ς sud the object of this letter isto induoe him to return. The
oommentstors generally have every mean opinion of Bullutius, who bas suffered at their
hands berder measure than any of Horaoe's friends. But his chief vioe seems to have
been e fondness for travelling, eud an especiel sdmiration of some of the lineat aud most
snoient towns in the world. lf we are to edd to this that for some reason or other he
was unbappy‚ and thought to relieve himself by change of soene, he msy bave been mis-
takeu in his meane, but if eo plenty of people heve shared iu his mutale, and when
Herses puts before Bullatius as the end of life the enjoyment of the present moment-e
doctrine he seems to have held pretty strongly,—we may doubt whether his philosophy is
not at least as bed aa his friend's practice. But we need not meme uuy thing injurious
to Bubetios. Such reflectione upon travel as ooour in this Epistle might natvirallybeve
suggested themselves whomsoever it had been written to. We are not to judgo llorsoe's
llpistles es we would private letters, meant only for the reading of the persone they are
written to.

We have αο meens of lnowing when the Epistle was written.

ARGUMENT.

Whet think you, Bodatius, of the fine plnoes of the llast? arethey not all tame oompsred
with our Campus and liber? llere you set your hess-t upouone of Attalus' towns,
or are you so tired of travelling that γοα must settle down at Lebedus, the dullest of
pluees, es you know ? And yet I could live there for a time, I ooufess, forgetting home
and every body, to look out upon the stormy sea. But the traveller who turns iu to
his favern to rest would not stay there for ever3 and he who warms himself by the fire
or a hot bath does not make these the end of his life. So if you have been tempest-
tost, and have been glad to put into port, is thet sny remon why you should sell your
ship and never eume beck? These parts arevery well for sielr people, butaslong as
health aud fortune let γοα be st Rome, stay here and preise Samos eud the raet at a
distance. Be thaulfiil for the blessings of the day, sud live for the present hour; so
will you be happy whatever plaoe you may be iu. ’Tis reason thet takes away sorrow,
und we only change our olim when ve shift our place. Itis bnt s busy idleness that·
employa us when we seek happiness in ships and in oosohes. All you ventis here or
at dull Ulubrae, if your heart be true aod fell you not
