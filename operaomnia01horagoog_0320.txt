OARMEN VI.

The Scholiset Porphyrion seys of this ode that itis directed against some man who
vves given ιο attacking virulentiy unoti'ending persons. Acron says his name wss Caesius,
and that he was s sisnderous poet. Componuding these statemenh, and smplifying them
frons hie own head and the languuge of the ode, Cruqnius’ Scholiset makes Οοοοίοο ιο ιο
Curius Severus, an orator of great celebrity end bitterness, whowee banished by Augustus,

three years efter the composition of this ode. This Scholiest’e authority is destroyed by
his own description of Severus, who, he says, was very abusive and attached the best of
men, but was easily appensed by filling his belly and plying him with money, for which
reason Horace compares him ιο s dog, &c This ie the lenguageof e mere compilor, and
