CARMEN ΙΙ.
n.u.c. 738.

'l'he tortunes oi Iulus Antonius, son oi the triumvir, his rise and tragicd end, dc not
concern this cde. He was a man ciletters and a pupil oi L. Crassitius, a mmmarian
who kept a school at Ῑδοιιιδ, to which many sons oi the noble iumilies were sent (see
Dict Biog. Οιιιιεὶιίιιι). Hc received therefore a good education, and we have it on the
authority of the Scholiasta that he wrote an heroic poem on the inmunes of Diomed, in
twelve books, besides some prose-vorke. Acron says that his poem was excellent3 bnt, as

¹ it is not likely hc ever saw it, his testimony is not worth much. (Sec Hcyne, Ere. Aen. x.
243.) Horace pays him the compliment oi suying that he could celebrate Angusttts' vic-
torius much better than himself, bnt this hc said to Maecenas (C. ii. 12. ll); and, though
hum thatpasssge and this we may believe thet Maecenas wrote prose and Antonine
poetry, the quality os either and the subjects cannot be inserted from any data Horace
has given us. The Scholiasta write the name ‘tunm' but‘ Iulus’ is the correct torm.
Bonam we hnow nothing oi Antonius' poetical powers except from this ode, and because
ci thedistance between the two names, ‘lule’ (v. 2) and ‘Antoni' (v. 26), some critica heve
changed ‘Iule’ into ‘Ille' (Peerlkamp. in loco Eiehstadt. Paradox. Horat. i. p. 9), and
supposed ‘ Antoui' to mean Antonius Rufus, who is mentioned hy Acron (on A. P. 289) and

· Comm. Cruq. as one who wrote comedy; bnt the existence oi such s person is very doubt·

inl, though Suetonius mentions a mammerian oi that name, and Ovid speaks of one

Rufus who wrote lyric poetry ester the manner oi Pindar (Ex Pont. iv. 16. 27, sqq.) ι

“Et qui Maeoniam Phaeacida vertit3 et una
Pindaricae fidicen tn quoqne, Rufe, lyras.”

But there is no reason to suppose his name was Antonius. ln a.n.c. 737 the Sigambri,
with two other German tribes, mosssd the Rhiue and laid waste part oi the Roman
territory in Gaul. 'lhey defeated the legate Lollius, and this disaster was sufficient to
induce Augustus (Dion Casa, ot. 19, intimates that he had other macne, especially bis

² personal nnpopnlarity at Rome and his intriguce with Terentia, which is mere gosaip)

to go iu person to Gaul, which he did, and st his approach the Gemens withdraw into
their own territorias, and giving hostages obtained peace. The· defeat oi Lollius had
caused great consternation at Rome, and the news oi the berhariaus' subjection was hailed
with proportionate ioy. Augustus did not return ior two years to Rome, having mean-
while restored order in Germany, Gaul, and Spain3 but it is probahle thie ode was
written in the expectation of his return and while thc news respecting the Sigambri was
still fresh, thatie to say, about the end of nuc. 738. Augustus' return to Rome was
expected long before it took place (ses C. δ of this book). 'I'he genmal impressiore
derived from the ode is that Antonius had pressed Horace to write a wem in honour ol
Augustns’ victory in the style ot Pindar's ἐπινίκια, and that he very wisely deolined,
though his iriend 'litius (Epp. i. 3. lo) was more hold, und liuius above mentioned was
ac too.

ARGUMENT.

whose would rival Pindar must expect Icarue’ iate. His numbers roll like a swollen
river. His is thebay, whether he tune the dithyramb or sing oi gods and heroes, of
victore or oiwomen bereaved. The swan of Dirce soars to the clouds: lamentosa
bee sipping tbe tlcwers oi 'libnn Τδοιι, Antonius, shalt sing oi the triumphs oi Cassan
greatest and best, and os the hcliday rejoioings that hail his return : aud 1 will add my
small voice to thine= and we will all sing conge oi triumph and will sacrifice, thou with
bulla and cows, 1 with a young heiter.
