709, the year before J ullus Caesar was 111111111111. After that event
Brutus and Cassius left Rome and went to Greeoe. Foreeeeing the
struggle thet was before them, they got round them many of the young
men at thet time studying at Athens, and Horeoe was appointed tri.

He went with Brutus into Asia Minor, and finally ehared his defeat at
Philippi, 111. 111. He makes humoroue allusion to thie defeat in his
Ode to Pompeius Varus (ii. 7). After 1111 battle he 11111 to Italy,
having obtained permission to do eo, like many othere who were willing
to give up 1 desperate 11111 and settle quietly at home. His patri.
mony', however, was forfeited, and he seems to have had no meane 11
subsistenoe, which induoed him to employ himself inwriting 111111, with
the view perhaps of bringing himself into notioe’ rethor than 111 the
purpose 11 making money by their sele. Itis not impossible, however,
that some of hie earliest eompositions were severe personel satirae end
lampoous, written at the instigation of those who were ableto pay

whieh his judgment allowed him afterwards to publish, though some
11 these 111 bed enough. With Aruhiloohus and Lucilius before him
11 models, and without the experienee he afterwards gained, hie earliest
productione may without difficulty be supposed to hare been eueh-

get 1 pleae ae eoriba¹ in the Quaestor’s ollioe, whether by purchase

he pureuod without 1111 making many enemies. Η11 Satires are full 11
