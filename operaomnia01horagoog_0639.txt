’ Fauorinus Agrippae Siculis quos colligis, Ioci,
Si reete frueris non estut copia major

Ab Jove donari possit tibi. 'l'olle querelas ;
Pauper enim non est cui rerum suppetit usus.
Si ventri bene, ei lateri est pedibusque tuis, nil
Divitiae poterunt regales addere majus.

Si forte in medio positorum abstemius herbis
Vivis et urtica, sic vives protinus ut te
Confestim liquidus Fortunae rivus innuret;

Vel quia naturam mutare pecunia nescit,

Vel quia cuncta putas una virtute minora.
Miramur si Democriti pecus edit agellos
Cultaque dum peregre est animus sine corpore velox;
