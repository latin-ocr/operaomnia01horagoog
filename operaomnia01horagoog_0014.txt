hes added them ιο his own commentury in a separate form. These
scholia are referred to under the abbreviated title of Gomm. Gruq.
They are chiefly made up of the commentaries of Acron and Por-
phyrion, with some additions apparently from other old authorities.
The readings of these three Scholiasta help out the MSS, though
sometimes they are not supported by any that are known now.

The editions that l have consulted Ι vill not tire the reader hy

upon so often as Horace. The editions 1 have always referred to
when a difficulty of interpretation occurred are those of Ascensius
(1519), with the scholia of Acron and Porphyrion, Lambinus,

Landini, publishedat Floreuce iu 1482, and reprinted at Venice the

His notes on law-terma are valuable, but in such matters I have
been chiefly indebted ιο the judgment of my friend and coadjutor
Mr. Long, whose advice I have lilrewise followed in many other
