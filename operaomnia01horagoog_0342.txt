312 HORATII FLAOGI

Annnna jam teritur bellis civilibus aetas,
Suis et ipsa Roma viribus ruit:

Quam neque finitimi valuerunt perdere Marsi
Minacis aut Etrusca Porsenae manus,

Novisque rebus infidelis Allobrox,

Nec fera caerulea domuit Germania pube
Parentibusque abominatus Hannibm

Impia perdemus devoti sanguinis aetas,
Ferisque rursus occupabitur solum. 10

Eques sonante verberabit ungula,

Quaeque carent ventis et solibus ossa Quirini,
N elas videre! dissipabit insolens.
