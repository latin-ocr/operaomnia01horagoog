HORATII FLAGOI

ARGUMENT.

Some men think my setire too severe, othere think it wents power. Tell me, Trebatim,
what sm l to do?

Keep quiet.

tht, not write et eil?

Thetis my edrico.

Well certsinly it would be better3 but 1 csn get no rest.

Tben go end swim the liber, or drink treely over night· ·‚or ίί you must write, write of
Caeser' ι ιιιοιιιι, end you will get yonr rewtrd.

Good iether, 1 heve no shengtb tor thet: the bettio-field ιι not ι fit theme for every one.

But you mey write οί his virtues sud his fortitude, ιι Lucilius wrote οί Scipio'e

So 1 will when opportunity offers. But Ceeser ιι only ιο be epprosched ιι the proper
time. Stroke him clumsily end like ι spirited horse he kicks.

But how much better is this then to libel buffoons end prodignls, end so mske en enemy
oi every body.

thtsmltodo? Everymsnheshis teste, end mine is to string words together, es
Lucilius did. He hustod ell his secret thoughts to his books: in prosperity οι ιιίιιιέιρ
he mede them his friends3 ιο ιίιιι ιίιιιι yon see the msn's life drawn ont ss in ι
picture. Him the humble poet οί Venusia follows. But 1 ettsck no one without pro-
vocation: why should l? I desire pesce, but woe to the men thet rouses me. He'll
suffer for ίι, end find himself the talk οί the town. And this is in the course of nature.
Every enimel defends itsell' with its own proper weepons. Τίιι long end short of ίι ίι
1 must write whether I sm to die presently or in ι quiet old ege, richer poor, et home
or sn exile, whatever or wherever 1 may he.

Young men, l seer your liis is not worth much: your great friends will heezeyou ιο
ιίιιιίι. ’

Why, were Leelius end Scipio offended with Lucilius when he ettscked ell the guest mm
ol his dsy, spering none but the uir-tuone? Ney, they loved him end lived with him
most semilierly. 1 msy be much beneeth Lucilius ίιι wenlth end genius3 but 1 ιοο
heve illustrious hiends‚ end ii eny one thinks ιο put his teeth into me be will find him-
self mistuken. Do you object ιο thet, Trebatius?

No, I do not. But 1 must remind you thet if eny men write somnilom ιοιιιιιιιιίιιιι
enother the lew ellows him ι remedy.

1 grsnt you, scurrilous: hut whet if they ere good end proper verses, end the person
worthy ιο be exposed?

Why then the court will leugh st the joke‚ end you will come off scot tres.
