HORATII FLAOOI

OARMEN XII.
nnc. 725-729.

Merosllus muried Julis, the dsughter ol Augustus, nnc. 729, sud died 731. The
nllusion in v. lb ol this ode mskes it quite certuin thst it wns written betors the desth oi
Meroellus, sud nster he hsd sttsined sn sgs in which hs could give promise oi sustsiuing
the distinction oi his nsme. The meaning oi thst stsuzs is plsinly this: ·‘ The fsm0 oi
the house oi Muoeuus, tskiug its birth from the grest Clsndins the victor ot Syrmus,
is growing up through successive generations like the insensible growth ol s tres, sud
promises to coms to msturity in Octsvis's sou.” Fhsnke thinks the ode wsswritten
before Augustus went sgsinst the Cnntsbn’sns in 729, sud ebout the time oi Marcellus'
msrrisgs‚ when hewse only in his sighteenth yssr. Others plsoe it nster Angustus'
return from Spsin in suno. 730, end the closing oi the temple ol anus. Ι think with
Frsnke some sllusion to this event would hsve besu mede hsd the ode been written then.
Torrentius thinks it wss one ol those hymns which by order ol the Senste (socording to Dion
Coss.) were mdressed todugostusssegod, estertbebettleoirictium. Atthst time ldsr-
osllus wss but iu his fonrteenth yser, but even then Augustus wss very ioud oi him snd
hsd grest hopes othim. The poem hss much oi the eppesrsnosoi sn ode immusic,
but s hymn oomposed on the oocssion Torrentius supposes could hsrdly hsve friled to
slludeto the successes it wss intended to oclebrste. 1 prefer Frunke's opinion to the
othersr but there is no possibility iu my judgment ci fixing the dete pnsdssly. nuc.

The opening is tskeu from the ssoond Olympic ode oi Pindsr, which begins-

ἀνοξιφὸρμιγγες ὕμνοι.
rivo θεὸν, rlv’ ἥρωα, riva δ’ ἄνδρα κελαδήσομεν 3
But thorout of the ode seems to be originsl. Pindsr ssks whom he shsll sing, sud im·
medistely sings of 'l'herom Herses, though he mske Augustus the climsr of his song,
goes through the prsises ol J ove snd his children, sud then oi twelve of Rome’s principsl
worthies before becomes to Augrsstns. The common inscriptions therefore ⁴⁴ nn docos·
norff or ⁴¹ ns Aoousro,” do not seem to express the scope ot this ode, which isrstber to
celebrate the populnr divinities und heroes of Rome then Augustus exclusively3 though
this design is so worked out ss to drnw the chief sttention to him.

ARGUMENT.

Whom wilt thou sing smong gods or men, Clio? Whoss nsme shsll the echoes ot
Helicon or Pindus repent, or ot Haemus whose woods followed the sweet music ot
Orpheus? Whom before the slmighty Esther, who knows uo oqusl or second? Ades·
him oomotln Psllss sud then breve Liber, sud the huntrms Dinon, snd Phoebus the
srcher, und llerctrles end leds’s sons, the horsemsn sud the igiter, before whose stsr

'the tempests ily. 'l'hen shnll it be Romulus, or the perosiul Nums, or proud Tsrquiu‚
or Ceto thet nobly died? Regulus, snd the Sceuri‚'end Paulus, who gsve up his grou
soul to the Carthaginien grstefully 1 will sing, end Fabricius, sud Curius, sud Csmil·
lus, sll esium t'or wer in povcrty's school. Tho ieme ol Marcellus isgrowiug up
insensibly like s tres, end the ster oi Julius is brighter then ell sturs. To thes, grest
Fsther, is given the esre ot Caesen shnrs with him thy kingdom Pntting Psrthisns
to flight sud snbduing the nstions oi the sut, he sbsll rnle the world ss thy viergerent

ζῶ t: ‘iffa' swsy, while thou dost shnke Olympus sud hurlest thy bolts upon the
un o pisty.
