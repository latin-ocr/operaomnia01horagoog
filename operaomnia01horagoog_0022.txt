xvi INTRODUGTION.

book, of which one or two poeme are among Horece'eeerlieetoompoei- π’
tione, may heve been publiehed in ane. 724. In that year wae written, :f
ae it would eeem, the eixth Setire of the eeoond book, which book 'ee‘
therefore wee not probably publiehed till the end of 724 or the beginning cie
of the next year, when Horace wee about thirty-lire yeere old. :t

When Auguetue returned from Asia, in nnc. 725, and closed the iu

getee of denne, being the colmowledged head of the republie, Horace c't',
appeared emongethiemoetheerty adherente. Hewroteonthieoocaeion
one of hie beet Odee (i. 2), end employed hie pen in forwerding those est
Ι reforme which it wee the fir-et object of Auguetue to effect. (See Intro· jfe‘
duction to O. ii. 15.) Hie meet striking Odee appear for the moet part t
to heve been written efter the eetabliehment of peeee. Some may heve e ‘s
been written before, and probably were. But for eome reeeon it would t
eeem that he gere himeelf more to lyric poetry after hie thirty-fifth yeer t,

then he had done before. He hed meet likely etudied the Greek poete

while he wee at Athene, and eome of hie imitatione moy have been ι 4
written early. Η eo, they were moet probably improved and poliehed '32

from time to time (for he muet have hed them by him, known perhepe ’ 44
only tc a few frienda, for many yeare) till they became the greceful 4

specimene of artificiel composition thot they ere. Horace continued to
employ himself in thie kind of writing (on e variety of eubjecte‚ oon-

viriel, amatory, politicel, moral; eomc original, meny no doubt euggeeted 44
by Greek poeme) till nne. 730, when I em inclined to think the three 4

firet booke of the Odee were publiehed. Icennot here diecuae the

subject, but I have coneidered end etated in the ceee of each Ode the ,gi
evidencee, if eny, thet it contains of ite date, and 1 ean find none which 4
may not be placed in that yeer or before it. Bentley'e theory, which 444
limite Horace to one epeciee of compceition at n time, and euppoeee eech · .-

of the three firet booke of Odee to heve been publiehed reperetely‚ I heve
no seith in3 end he overlooke the fact thet the twenty-fourth Ode of the

firet book wee certainly written four yeare after thot in which he plaoee e
the publication of that hook. (hinton, who eupporte Bentley (Feet. Hell. , ⁴.

nc. 38), cen only do eo by euppoeing that in the preeent copies eome
piecee may heve been trenepoeed, which ie begging the question.

Franke hee arrived, ee fer ee I cen judge, at the right conclueion upon
thie subject. During thie period Horace appeare tc have paeeed hie

time at Rome among the meet distinguiehed men of the day, or et hie
houee in the country, paying occneional vieite to Tibur, Praeneste,
and Baiae, with indifferent beelth‚ which required change of air.

About the yeur nuo. 728 he wae nearly killed by the falling ofe ἱ

tree, on hie own eetate, which eocident he hae recorded in one of hie
Odee (ii. 13), end cocceionnlly refero to; once in the eenre atenea with a
