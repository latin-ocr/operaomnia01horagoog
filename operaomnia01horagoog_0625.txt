EPISTOLARUM Ι. 8.

Guuso gaudere et bene rem gerere Albinovano
Musa rogate refer, comiti scribaeque Neronis.

Si quaeret quid agam, dic multa et pulchra minantem
Vivere nec recte nec suaviter3 haud quia grando
Contuderit vites oleamque momorderit aestus,

Nec quia longinquis armentum aegrotet in agris;
Sed quia mente minus validus quem corpore toto
Nil audire velim, nil discere, quod levet aegrum3
Fidis offendar medicis, irascar amicis,

Gur me lunesto properent arcere veterno ;

Quae nocuere sequar, fugiam quae profore credam ;
Romae 'l'ibur emem ventosne, Tibure Romam.
Post baec ιιι valeat, quo pacto rem gerat etse,

Ut placeat juveni percontare utque cohorti.

si dicet, Recte, primum gaudere, subinde
Praeceptum auriculis hoc instillare memento:

Ut tu fortunam sic nos te, Celse, feremus.
