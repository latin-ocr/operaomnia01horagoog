GARMINUM ΙΙΙ. 6.

Fertur pudieae conjugis osculum
Parvosque natos ut capitis minor
Ab se removisse et virilem
Torvus humi posuisse voltum:
Donec labantes consilio patres
Firmaret auctor nunquam alias dato,
Interque maerentes amieos
Egregius properaret exsul.
Atqui sciebat quae sibi barbarus
Tortor pararet3 non aliter tamen so
Ι Dimovit obstantes propinquos
Et populum reditus morantem,
Quam si clientum longa negotia
Dijudieata lite relinqueret,
Tendens Venafranos in agros
Aut Lacedaemonium Tarentum.

CARMEN VI.
About amc. 728.

As the former odes are addressed more to qnalities ot young men, this refers more
especially to the vices oi young women, and so Horace discharges the promise with which
this series oi odes begins. 'l'he state oi female morals at the time Horace wrote was
probably not se bad as it mmo shortly afterwards, though his picture is dark enough.

ln v. la there is an allusion to the battle oi Actium, which males it evident that this
cde was written aiter that event. There is no elue to the date bnt this, and we may fairly
aarum that it was written about the same time as the others cithia set.
