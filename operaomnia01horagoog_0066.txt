to thedey 01 their desth!

Onu tu, Lydia, Telephi

Cervicem roseam, cerea Telephi
Laudas brechia vae meum

Feruens difficili bile tumet jecur.
Turn nec mens mihi nec color

(ierte sede menet, humor et in genes
Furtim labitur, arguens

Quam lentis penitus macerer ignibus.
Uror, seu tibi candidos

Turperunt humeros immodicae mero 10
Rixae sive puer furens

Impressit memorem¹ dente labris notem.
Non, si me setis audias,

Speres perpetuum dulcia barbare
