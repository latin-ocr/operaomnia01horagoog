The date ofthis ode is lixed with some confidence by Franke auc. 723, by Dilleubr.
72¹», because it was written the year before C. iii. θ. (See Introduction to that ode, and
iii. 29.) Τ1ιο invitation to Maecenas was written evidently for the first anniversary of the
accidant referred tc in this ode. Lachmann (Ep. ιο Fraulre, p. armenorium itte be one
of llorace's earliest, in consequence of the metre of v. 27, “ Alcaeo, plectro dura navis ;”
and for similar reasons he pute C. iii. Β at an early date. But such conclusions have been
already notioed. There is nothing iu them, as I believe, whatever. The latter part of
the ode is a remarkable instance of Hcraee’s wayof digressing into subjects only remotely
connected with his principal meme.
