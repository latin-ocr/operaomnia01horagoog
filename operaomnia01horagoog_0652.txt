ιιι HORATII FLAOOI

Aut paulum abstulerat patinas coenabat omasi

. Vilis et agninae, tribus ursis quod satis esset;
Scilicet ut ventres lemna candente nepotum
Diceret urendos, corrector Bestius. Idem
Quidquid erat nactus praedae majoris ubi omne
Verterat intumum et cinerem, Non hercule miror,
Aiebat, si qui comedunt bona, cnm sit obeso
Nil melius turdo, nil vulva pulchrius ampla.
Nimirum hic ego sum; nam tute et parvula laudo
oum res deficiunt, satis inter vilia lortis;
Verum ubi quid melius contingit et unctius idem
Vos sapere et soloe aio bene vivere, quorum
Conspicitur nitidis tundata pecunia villis.
