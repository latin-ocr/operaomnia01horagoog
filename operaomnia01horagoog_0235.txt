CARMEN XXVII.

The length οι this odeis more imposing thsn the subjectos it, whichuppeers to ιο
n jonrney ιο Greeee (v. 19) proposed ιο ιο tehen by s lsdy oi Horree’s neqneintmce,
whom he pretends ιο dster from her purpose, by reciting the dungers she will heve to
sneountm und the frte thet wuito upon semele ohstinscy, es illustnsted hythe story of
Europe, which story occupies two-thirds οι the ode snd thrnsts Gelutee eud her journey
from the sesne altogether. l dc not see the difficulty oi the ode thet hes errested most
οι the editors The length οι the digression is simply c wey with Horres (ss in the
story οι Regulus, C. iii. ι, end oi Hypermestre, iii. 11). end Pinder took the
sume liberty with grentes freedom. Ιι is s peculisrity which imitators οι Herses will do
well ιο note, ior ιι skilfolly mensged it would relieve the tumeness οι many en ode which,
professing ιο ιο un imitation of this unthor, hes little but his rhythm sud n lew of his
phrases ιο snstsin the resemhlsnoe.

By similer arguments Propertius (i. 8) dotem cynthi· from going ιο ses, end Ovid
Corinna (Am. ιι. ll). The Scholirst on Homer (Il rii. ³07) seys the story oi Europe
was treeted by Βιοοιγιιὰοο, whose poem has not come down ιο us, nor eny pert οι ιι, hut
was prohshly, ss Orelli ruys, iu Herses's hunde. The Scholiest's account οι ιιο story is
just thet οι ιιο present ode. ltwonld he difficnlt to lind n more touehing picture thun
lloruce hus drswn οιο young girl suddenly torn imm her childish amusements, muns-
ported fer hom the security οι her home, end leit lorloru smong stc-engere, knowing no tie

reprosch: her fsnlt hed been giving wey ιο n ioolish impulse, ιιιι she sees her <nime
through her leurs, which megniiy it grectly ιγ pointing ιο its probsble issue, so thst she
looks npou her idle ωτιοοιιγ ss nothing less then msdness (r. 36). There is elso great
slill in the lust stunres, in which we heve, first, the derisive lenghter with which Venus

hreek in upon the unhsppy girh then the ironicel prophecy in which her own words crs
used egsinst her; end, lestly, the seriem consolation end congruhrlstion with which they
mnounoe her good fortune, und bid her rise to ιι. The pain meing from her eomplnint
is thus relieved, und we ere lest with the conviction thet she is reconciled to her destiny
