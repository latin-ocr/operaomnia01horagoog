Pompeius Grosphus, ιο whom the leth ode of this book is written (see Introduction),
und who is mentioned in the twelfth epietle of the first book (v. 22). But the proscribed
follower of Brutus eennot be identified with the weslthy Grosphus, es Estne hee obserred,

republican party who hed followed Sextus Pompeius were ellowed to return, pesce being

Kirehner (Ο. Η. p. ι) strongly supports this opinion. Dscier esks why theu Homoe

to me, whether even in jeet Horace would heve elluded to Philippi in the wey he here

prebebis thet Pompeius did not return to Rome, ee Acron intimetes, till efter the civil
