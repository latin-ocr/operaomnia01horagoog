336 HORATII FLAOOI

SATIRE ΙΙ.

ThisSstiresppeursto huvebeenwritteu on the doeth of Tigellium musidun of grestre-
pute, who, ss we lesrn from the opening verse of the next Sutirs, ιιι οι terms of fsmilisr
intimscy with C. Julius Csesur. The Scholiusts who cull him M. Hermogenes Tigellius
ιι] thet he ιῆιιπιιιι became ι fsvourite with Cleopstru, und then uguin with Augustus.
Acron says Horace qusrrelled with him ιιοιιιι he found funlt with the rhythm of his
verses. lt is probuble thot this Tigellius is misoelled M. Hermogenes, end thet this
nume belongs only ιο another Tigellius who wes niso ι singer mentioned in 8. 3. lues
4. 72; 9. 253 10. ld, 80, 9⁰. These persons ιιι never been sepersted till Decies
distinguished between them. Heindorf ιιιιιοι ιο the old opinion, which 1 think ιιι
been sutisluctorily disposed of by Kirchner in his trustise “De Utroque Tigellio '¹
(Quuest Hor. p. ιι, sqq.). 'Ihe Tigellius of thiu Sutire is culled Surdus, ι uerutum, in
the next (v. ³). It eppesrs from the Scholimts ιιιι he ιιι sttsoked by licinius, from
whom they quote this verse: “ Surdi 'ligelli putidum ceput venit.” lle wus probnbly
therefore ι libertinus. Cicero ιιι ι quurrel with this person, whose hrtluenoe with
Csessr ιιι such ιιιι it mede him ruther euxious, though he effectu in some of his leem
ιο hold the mun cheep. Compare Epp. ιι Tum. vii. 24. Ad Ast. xiii. 49, ιθ, ιιιιι.
He ιοο ιιιιοι ιο licinius’ verse, ιιι cells Tigellius ⁴⁴ hominem pestilentiorem petris
ιιι (the climate of Snrdiniu wss couuted very bed) sddictum jum dudum Cslvi Licinii
Hipponacteo praeconio ” (Ad Fsm. l. c). The churucter of Tigellius is drewn cleverly
iu the opening verses of the next Setire.

The statement of the Scholissts οι v. et of this Sutire, thot some supposed (ιο Porph.
ιιι Corum. Cruq. put it; Acron seys et onos “Mnoenarem tungit”) thot, under the
neme ιιιιοιὶιιι, Horsce mesos to sutirize Muecenus, seems ιο me unworthy of the leuet
credit. But it ιιι ιιι wsrm defenders, ιιι upon this assumption the dote of the Sutire
is fised, both Kirchner und ιιιιιι pluciug it in s.u.c. 71⁴, in order ιο ollow sufficient
time between the composition of the libel, ιιι the introductiou of Horsce ιο his petron
1 will not trouble the render by going into the argument, except to ιι] thet, if the libel
ιιι ιιοι enough ιο offend, it is ιι improbsble Horuoe would hnve published us thet he
would heve written it, efter his introduction ιο Μωοιιιιῑ ιιι if (ss uppeurs ιο me) theru
is nothing ιο odend in the ιιιιο, it wus ss probably written efter ιι before their soqusint·
unce begen. But 1 do not believe Mseoenus ιιι uny thing ιο ιο with the verse st ull.
Αι early dete must be assigned ιο ιιι Setire, becsuse it certninly preceded the ιιι, ιιι
ιιιι sguin wus composed before the lethot this Book. Whether the οοιιιιιιιι of the
ideus ιιι longnsge, ιιι the wunt of urtistio mungement ιιι connexion, ιιι] not be uu
argument for ιι esrly dete, deserses consideretiou. (See Introduction ιο S. ι.) lt is
without exception the οοιιιιιι οι ull Horsce's Setirss, ιιι, with reference ιο the point
it professes ιο turn upon, the leust to the purpose. Icsn ιτιοι ιο connexion between
the text which iscontuined iu v. sl (⁴‘ fools trying ιο uvoid one cluss of vices run into
their opposites ’') ιιι ιιι licentious lungusge und sdrioe uontuined in the letter hulf
of ιιο satire, which in brief amounts to thius ‘do not let s fulse ombition lesd you
into intriguing with murried women, but melre yourself hsppy with prostitutus! The
exemples which uppem ιο bs ιο the purpose ure not so iu reslity. Tigellius, we moy be
sure, did not give his money ιο ιιιιοιι ιιι impostore ln order ιο svoid the churucter of
