the worda seem to imply a longer aud more matured friendahip3 and the epithet ‘elam’
which would have been mere damry when 'liberius was twenty-two aud haddone nothing,
would suit him very well aiter his meeeaaee against, the Raeti celebrated in C. ir. u. in
a.u.c. 743, 'liberius was seut hy Augustus agdnat the Dalmatiam and Pannoniane, and
was absent from Rome four years, with the exception oia short interval, when he brought
home the remeius uf his brother Drusus, ⁸a.u.c. 745. (Dion Caua¹ 54. 31; 55. 2.)
Kirehner (Qu Hor. p. 39) thinks thet florus amompanied him, and that this Epistle
was written the year ui their depmture, and publiahed tha next year, when he supposes
the letter to Augustus was written. This may be trus, but 'liberius went with Augustus
to Gaul mue. 738, aud Florus may have been with him then. 'l'he objectiou to that
date ia that Horaee did uertainly write verses about that time, of the kind Florus asked
fon aud though thiais not euncluaive, ior he wrote with no great lore ior the malt, on
the whole l think a later date ia more probahle.

Thth there does not pruieas to be much substance in the Epletle 1 think it the meat
agreeahle oi all. 'l'he stories in illustration are very well told ς the description oi the
town andita enuoyaneea has the soree without the harahnses oi Juvenalr the ranity oi
authors ie ridiculed in a happy aud humoroua wey, and the adriee given them ia guody
and thoughts usual thu ammon at the end about money and philosophyis perhaps a little
tedium, and not very eonvineing, aa a whole the Epiatle is written in a popular style, and
the language and versificatiou are easyand οοποοῐ. It is always pleasant likewiae to hear
Heraea speaking of himself, thu events oi his iiie, and the peculiaritiea oi his cham.
This Epiatie fundshea maoenala ior a considerable partui hia biography, and makes ua
acquainted with his puetiual uareer in particular. lt representa him as writing more hum
nauemty than out of love to poetq, aud it would not he diffieult to tram tha forus oi a
pressure irum without in many parta oi his wurka.
