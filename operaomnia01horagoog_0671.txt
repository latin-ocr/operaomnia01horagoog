EPISTOLARUM Ι. 18.

Quamvis nil extra numerum secisse modumque
(iuras, interdum nugaris rure paterno ς
Partitur lintres exercitus; Actia pugna

Te duee per pueros hostili more refertum
Adversarius est frater, lacus Hadria, donec
Alterutrum velox Victoria fronde coronet.
Consentire suis studiis qui crediderit te,
Fautor utroque tuum laudabit pollice ludum.
Protinus ut moneam, si quid monitoris eges tu,
Quid de quoque viro et cui dicas saepe videto.
Percontatorem fugito, uam garrulus idem est,
Nec retinent patulae commissa fideliter aures,
Et semel emissum volut irrevocabile verbum.
Non aneilla tuum jecur ulceret ulla puerve
Intra marmoreum venerandi limen amici,

Ne dominus pueri pulchri caraeve puellae
Munere te parvo beet aut incommodus angat.
