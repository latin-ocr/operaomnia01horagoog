386 Ι HORATII FLAOGl

Villa recepisset, lacrimoso non sine fumo,

Udos cum foliis ramos urente camino.

Hic ego mendacem stultissimus usque puellam
Ad mediam noctem exspecto: somnus 111111 aufert

Signis perfacile est: venit vilissima rerum

Hic aqua; sed panis longe pulcherrimus, ultra
Callidus ut soleat humeris portare viator;
