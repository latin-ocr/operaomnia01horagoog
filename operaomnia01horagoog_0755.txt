Dictus ob hoc lenire tigres rabidosque leones;
Dictus et Amphion, Thebanae conditor arcis,

Ducere quo vellet. Fuit haec sapientis quondam,
Publica privatis secernere, sacra profanis,
Concubitu prohibere vago, dare juramentis,
Oppida moliri, leges incidere ligno :

Carminibus venit. Post hos insignis Homerus
Tyrtaeusque mares animos in Martia bella
Versibus exacuit; dictae per carmina sortes;
Et vitae monstrata via est3 et gratia regum
