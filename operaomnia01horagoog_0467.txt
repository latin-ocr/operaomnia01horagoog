him in Dict. Biog.). Horsoe seems tn heve been well 1000110101 with him, though he
wus muny yesrs younger then 'l'rebetius und itis snid thnt hewse deed when this Sutire
wns written. l nm inclined 10 doubt this, 101 though itis possible 1101101 1111] heve need
the old mnn's nume though he wne deed, it is more 1111111111 10 suppose thet he did 10

peseefrrl negotiotions with thet people, without 111] immediate intention or prospect 01
coming to blows with them. Thet the Sntire wnswritteu nster the eighth 01 the tirst bools
