010110 10 which he was 0001111001 off Cape Palinuras¹, on the western
00001 01 Italy. When this happened nobody knows. After the publica·
tion of the three books 01 Odes, Horace seems to have ceased from that
style 01 writing, 01000111 s0; 001110 only other compositionum know
01 110 having produced iu the next few years are metrical Epistles to
different friends, 01 which he published a volume probably in 000. 7 81
01735. 110 seems to have taken up the 0101101 110 Greek philoso-
phical writers, and to have got a good deal interested in them, and alac
to have become a little tired 01 110 world 001 disgusted with the
jealousics his reputation created. His health did 001 improve as he got
older, and he put himself under the care of Antonius Musa, the em·
peror's new physician ¹. By his advice he gave up, 101 0 time at least,
his favourite Baiae. But 101000111000000011 to be a good 10010101
from Rome, especially 10 110 autumn and winter ⁴.

In auc. 737 Augustus celebrated the Ludi 1100010100, and Horace
was required to write 00 Ode 101 110 occasion, which he did, and it has
been preserved. This circumstance, 001 110 010111 11 brought him, 0101
1010 given his mind another leaning to Ode-waiting, 001 1010 helped
him to produce the fourth book, afew pieccs in which may have been
written at 001 time. It 10 0011 1101 Augustus particularly desired
Horace 1ο publish another book 01 Odes, in order that those he wrote
upon the 110101100 01 Drusus 001 Tiberius (4 001 14) might appear in
it. The 10110101 11000 01001100 001 written, I believe, till 000. 7111,
11100 Augustus returned from Gaul. 11 so, the book was probably
published in that year, when Horace was 11111110. The Odee 01 110
fourth book show 00 diminution 01 power, but the reverse. There are
none in the three first books that surpass or perhaps equal the Ode
in honour 01 Drusus, 001 1011 superior to that which is addressed to
Lollius. The success 01 110 three first books, 001 110 honour 01 being
chosen tc composa tho Ode at the Ludi 80001010000010 to have given
him encouragement. There are no incidente iu his 1110 during the above
period recorded or alluded to in his poema. He lived five years 01101
110 publication 01 110 100111 book 01 Odes, 11 110 above date be correct,
and during that time 1 think it probable he wrote the Epistles 1010·
gustus and Florus which form the second book; 001 having conceived
the intention 01 writinga poemen the art 001 progress 01 poetry, he
wrote as much 01 11 as appears in the Epistle 10 110 Pisones which has
been preserved among his works. 'Phe fragments of which that poem
appears to be composed‚ and which some have 101011 tried to reduce 10
0 0000101001 whole, 10011010 been written earlier than I 1010 supposed;
