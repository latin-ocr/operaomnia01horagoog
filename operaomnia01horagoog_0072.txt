CARMEN XVI.

The poet Stesichorus, as the story goes, lost his eyesight ss s punishment for a poem
in which he appears to heve repeated the ordiner-y stories ugsinat Helen, aud did not
recorer it till he had written another poem recanting his opprobrious verses. Of this
παλινῳδία which is referred tc in Epod. xvii. 42, and which wus very familiarto the
audents, Pluto has preserved the opening verses in the Phscdrus, p. 243, A. lt began
thus :-

otc ἔστ’ ἔτυμος λόγος οὗτος·

οὐδ’ ἔβας ἐν νηυσὶν εὐσέλμοις,

οὐδ’ lese Πέργαμα Τροίας. (29 Bergk.)
'l'his poem hed s plain purpose with which the ode before us hus nothing in common.
Nevcrtheless ithus been generally supposed till of late years to be an imitation of stem
chorus, end some of the grammarisns have prefixed to tha ode che title ‘¹ Ad Tyndaridem,”
no doubt under the same impression. The foundation of thie opinion sppesrs to have
been the statement of Acron: ¹⁸ Hanc oden in satisfactionem facit amicae ause, imitetus
Stesichorum pettam Siculum qui vituperationem scribens Helenae caecatus est et postea
responso Apollinis laudem ejus scripsit ct oculorum aspectum recepit.” He does not “
’ therefore sey thet Horace imitated the ode of Stesichorus but only hisexample. ltis very
probabis, aa Buttmann suggests, they got the name from the next ode and put it before
this, which contains uo name nor any clue to the person eddreased. Some Mss. have
the inscription “Palinodia Gratidius ad Tyndaridem,'’and whoever invented this inscription
must have supposed the ode to heve been addressed to the daughter of that woman, whom
he lempocus iu his Epodes. Cruquius' Scholiast affirms that it is eddressed to that
person herself, and thare are many who follow this view of the mse, among others Hein-
dorf ou S. i. 8. Franke is decidedly of that opinion, aud supposes this ode to have been
written about the saure time with Epcd. xvii, sud for the same mock purpose. 1 think
there can be little doubt in the mind of any oue who reads this poem, that it was composcd
(though not in seriousness) with reference to some verses Horace hed actually written,
aud that it is not s mere manslatiou of Stesichorus¹ or any other poem, while attho sama

time there ere Greek ideas in it, which he horrowed from that or some othei source.
Beyond this 1 am not bold enough to go.
