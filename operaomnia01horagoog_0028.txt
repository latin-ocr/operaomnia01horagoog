 

xxii INTRODUOTION.

O. i. a-nhis is another oi the Asclepiadem meires, consisting of
two verses alternating thus:

difflui-ez:

--l-UUl-ll-VVl-UU

The first of these verses is called aiter Glycona poet whose age and
birthplace are unknown. The second verse isthe sameas ei. 1. Το
this metre also belong 0. i. 13. 19. 363 ιιι. 9. 15. 19. 24. 25. 28; iv.
i. 3.

0. i. s-This metre has its name from Archilochus of Paros. It
consiste of alternate verses, oi which the firstis one of those that the
grammarians call ἂσυνιιρτητοι ⁸, because theyconsist of different mensures
which do not blend together. The first four feet are those of an hexa-
meter verse, after which follow three trochces, the first part being
always distinct from the second. The second is a catalectic iambic tri·
meter, thetis, ithus one syllable wanting in the last foot. There iano
other Ode in this metro.

0. i. 5.-'.l.¹his is ,also rechoned with the Asclepiadean meti-es, though
only the two first lines have their name from Asclepiades, being the
same as Ο. 1. The third is called aiter Pherecrates, the comic poet of
Athens. Ιι consiste of adnctyl between two spondees, if my ear does
not deceive me; but it is usual to marli it with a spondes, choriambus,

and long syllable. The fourth is the Glyconean verse, which occurs in
O. 3. Το this metre belong (l. i. 14, 21, 233 ιιι. 7, 13; iv. 13.

and perhaps ιιι ιιι line oi Horace:
⁴ Quindecim Diam preces virorum)

li Horace ιιι generally avoided this form of ιιι ιιιιι, ιιι dislilre seems to ιιιι been
diminished as his ear improved; ιο that while there labat one instance oi such a cae·
sura in the second book oi the Carmina, and not one in ιιι third, there are no less than
twenty-two ιιι ιιι ιοιιιιι, and in the Csrm. Sec. one on an average in every ιιιιιιι.
Nay, even in such lines as ‘Doctus et Phoebi chorus et Dianae' we prefer the double
nechea secent at ιιι commencement te ιιιι which Dr. Carey considers so sweet, who
virtually males ‘monis' a trocheo, and would, we suppose, give the sound oi adactyl to
ιιιιιιιιιι in ¹ Romulae genti date remque prolem Ι que lit decus omne! Is any one will
read over the C. S. with ιιι secent we contend lor, he will readily perceive the beanty oi
the metro, and cesse to wonder ιιιι Sappho and ΟιιιιΙΙιιι heaitated not tc male ιιι fourth
syllable short ln particular much beanty will be added to ιιι line ‘Jam Fides ιι Pax
ιι Honos Pudorque! According to Dr. Carey's notion oi amended nocent, ‘Par' will
lose all emphasis.”

⁸ πρῶτος ἀσυναρτὴτοις Ἀρχίλοχος attexemus (Hephaestion, p. 48, sp. Bentley on
lipod. n). 'lhe Scholisst on Hephaestion, p. ιι, says ιιιιι were no less than sixty·
four metros cithia sort used by tha Greeks.
