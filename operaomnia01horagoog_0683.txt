EPISTLE Ι.

Assone other anecdotos eonneooed with Angustus, Suetonius, iu his lite oi lloreee,
seye, “Post Sermones quoque leotoe, nullom sui mentionem habitem its est questuse
‘Iresoi me tibi seito, quod uon iu plerisque ejusmodi serIptis meeum potissimum
loqueris. An vereris ne opud posteros tibi inferne sit, quod ridesris iemillnris nobis eseet'
Expressitque elogium, eujus initium est, ⁴ Oumtot sustiness,’ '’ teo. Porphyrion, upon Epp.
i. 20, init, hee this nom: “ Ex his versibus et iu principio sequentis libri apparet llorstius
hoo volumen quasi novissimum totius operis habuisse. Nem seeundum epistolsrum
eoeotus sdjeu't;'’ end et the beginning oi this Epistle he esys: “Appsret huno librum, ut
supro diximus, hortstu Coessris seriptum esset eujus rei etiem Suetonius suotor σοῦ’
This Scholiset’s authority therefore erue probably no other thsn thet which we possess iu
the ebore nemon, which es eerly ut leuet us his dsy wne attributed to Suetoniu. But
there is no improbebility in the story. A similer theory hus been edvenoed in respect to
the sixth Ode oi the first book, uddressed to Agrippa, which, like this Epistle, depreoetes
the took oi attempting the preises of s greut men. Assuming the truth oi Suetonius’
statement, ve must pleoe the dete oi thie Epistle ester the publioution oi the first book.
lt is generslly supposed, with some probability, thst the Seoulsr Ode wes iu Horeoe's
mind when he wrote v. 132, sq. 1r eo, the Epietle vus not written till siler s.u.e. 737.
