SATIRARUM ΙΙ. 6.

SATIRE VI.
Ano. 724.

Whenever Horace tcuches on ιιιιιιοιι peracual ιο himself he does it with humour and ’

feeling. Ηο is also very rkilful in telling a story or representing a mmatic tablaau.
The fable of the town and country monae could hardly have been better told than itis
here. The apostrophe ιο ι1ιο country beginning ⁴0 rus, qnando te aspiciam,' and the
contrnst between a town and country life, are among his most natural touches; and the
allusion to his intimacy with Maecenas, and the envy it had brought upon him, is
managed with delioecy towards his petron, while it mewa in a very few words the mixture
of pride and annoysnce which the feeling agninst him caused. He outlived this feeling,
aa he tells us in C. iv. 3. 16 (see Introduction); but atthis time it perhaps mused him a
good deal of pain3 for he was not a man of vigorcua temperament capable of disregarding
a jeulousy he did not deservo, and he had none of the ambition which overleapa the
jealousyit creatae. He had no desire to be mixed up with public affairs5 and ifhe
sought Maecenas, ιι was in gratitude for his kindness and for the plensura of his society,
end that of the circle ιο which his patronage introduced him. When therefore vulgar
people appesled ιο him aa the depositas-y of state secreta and in the great man’s con-
fidence, it disturbed and annoyed him probably, aa he here with evident sincerity prc-
sesses.

'ibe histor-ica} references in this Satirc mark the dete ot its composition pretty accu-
rately. It appears (v. 53) that the Daci were in arms against tha Romans. Tbey helped
Antonius at Actium (C. iii. 6. lt, n), and tha following year, ΑΜ. ret, Μ. Crassm Ι
was sent against them. (Dion Cass. li. 23.) ln the same book (c. 3, aq.) Dion
relatas thnt the veternus who had fought at Actium, having been sent back ιο Italy, wera
discontented and broke out into mutiny because they had no reward. ln the middle of
the winter of amc. tet—724, Augustus οοιιιο frum Asia ιο Brundusium for the purpose
of quelling this mutiny, and gene money ιο some, and ιο the others he distributed laud iu
those districte which had been favourable ιο Antonius. 'l'his distribution had been pru-
mised but not made when this Satire was written (v. bb). In the absence of Angustus,
when he went against Antonius and till his return ιο Rome, Maecenas,at first singly
und utterwurds in conjunction with M. Agrippa, was deputed by Angustus ιο οιοιοιοο
those powers in the city and in Italy which he himself would have exerdsed hudhe been
there. (Dion Cass. li. ις Pliny xxxvii. 4.) This toois referred ιο in v. 38: all of which
goes ιο indicate the beginning of s.n.c. 724 as the time when this Satira was written.
In v. 4⁰ he says that upwards of seven yesre had passed since hc bacam intimate with
Maecenas3 edd to that the nine months that elapaed between his first introduction and
his recall (S. f. 6. 61), and we bring the former event ιο tha beginning of οπο. 716. How
long he had been in possession of his Sabine estate we cannot gether hom this Satire3
but there is nothing in it to disturb the opinion tbst itwm presented ιο him either in
n.u.c.7210r722. He speaks familisrlyof a country life no doubt, but one or two
scaaona there would give him a sufficient teate of that way of living ιο account for any
expressions in this poem.
