EPISTLE XIII.

'l'his letter professes ιο be written by Horace to one Vinius Asello, the besrerof namin
volumes of his to Augustus et Rome, Horsoe being probobiy et bis own estete. He
writes es if he hed given his friend particular sud snxious instructions when he started
sswhowhewsetobehsresndosifthiswss tube sent ester him to orertoke himen
the rond, in order ιο impress those instructions upon his memory. It is proheble that
nme such jokes moy hore possed between Ilorsce end his messenger when he merted,
sud thet he emused himself sftemurds by puttiug them into the form of this Epistle,
which it ts not uulikely he shewed Augustus3 hut more I think is mode of it in this
respect then it will beer, ss if it were written for the espedui purpose of commending to
Augintus the modesty of the writer, end spologising for the ἰοιτοείοιι, end so forth· Ι
csnuot seesny such design. 'l'he personis menmed to be ignorentof theworld,rnd
therefore lisbio to make mistskes in the execution of his mission; to inundo st sn un·
seuensble time; in the eogeruess of his affection for Horace to be too officious3 to απ]
mahometinorum ss to draw attention, or to stop in the streets in orderto teil
his mineus friends whot importent business he wss upon. The person oddrmed is
called Vinius, sud the ellenon inuti Iesds to the inferenee thot his cognomen wss
Asellus, or Asine, or Asello. Asellus wos s cognomen of the Annis, Claudio, sud
Cornelis gentes. Asine elso wes of the Cornelis„ Porphyrion culis the men Virrriius
Asello, while othe other Schohests coll him Coninins (which moy be sn error for esim)
Vinnius Fronto Asine 'ibere wss ono T. Vinius Philopoemen proscribed by the trium·
rirs for eonoeeliug his petronus, whose nome therefore wns the mure, ond the Vinio
gens wss in existence et this time. It hosbeen conjectured by Μαι, sndhelieredby
others, thet the person here addressed wes one of the tire tenente mentioned in the next
Epistle, r. 3. 'ibe conjecture msy be misen for whst it is worth. No one eon ‹feny unt
he moy heve been one of those persons. ile wss not, os Orchi ssys,s ‘tebellsrius’ or
letter oerrier, ss his mmo sufficiently shows, for s‘tsbellnrius' wss e sisse, yet me
heve treated him es such.

tht the volumus were thet Horace wss sending to Augustus it is impossible to ssy
for certain, but 1 think it probeble they contsIned the three first books of theoder, and,
if so, the Epistle wes probably written in u.u.c. 7³⁰· anke thinks so very decidedly3
but ull do not edopt thot dete, end some suppose the Setireo to be the ‘volumius' ne·
ferred to. ’
