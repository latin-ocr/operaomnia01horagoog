228 ΗΟΒΑΤΙΙ FLAOOI

Sensere quid mens rite, quid indoles
Nutrita faustis sub penetralibus 1
Posset, quid Augusti paternus
In pueros animus Nerones.
Fortes creentur sortibus et bonis;
Est iu juvencis, est in cquis patrum
Virtus, neque imbellem seroces
Progenerant aquilae columbam ;
Doctrina sed vim promovet insitam,
Rectique cultus pectora roborunt;
Utcunque defecere mores

Indecorant benc nata culpae.
Quid debeas o Roma, Neronibus

Testis Metaurum flumen et Hasdrubal
Devictus et pulcher fugatis
Ille dies Latio tenebris
Qui primus alma risit adorea,
Dirus per urbes Afer ut Italas
Ceu flamma per taedas vel Eurus
Per Siculas equitavit undas.
