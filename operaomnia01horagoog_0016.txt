If any have been suggested by my own memory or reading, I have

hope that Ι may not appear to have defrauded any one. Ι have
been careful as faras possible tolet Horace illustrate himself,
without however distracting the render by referring him backwards
and forwards to passages that will throw uo light upon the text.

The MSS. generally and most of the editions have inscriptions
or headings to the different poema. That these were not given
them hy Horace himself is clear, but they appear iu the earliest
MSS„ and are supposed by some to have been invented by the
grammarians almost contemporary with the author. They vary
very much in the different MSS. and as they are quite arbitrary
modern editors have seen the propriety of abandoning them. Aa
the same time, aa Kirchner says justly enough (Qu. Hor. p. 20),
they have their value aa showing the opinion of very early gram·
mariana as to the scope of the different poema, and I have accord-
ingly referred to them where they could be of any usc in aettling
disputed points.

the notes might be omitted hy merely referring the reader to the
Dictionaries of Antiquities and Biography edited by Dr. Smith.
But valuable as those works are, I found that the articles were not
and could not be so drawn up aa to save the necessity, in many

such an author as this. I have often referred to them, and if
I ought to have done so ofteuer the omission has heau uuinton·
