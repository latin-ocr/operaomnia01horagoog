EPISTLE I.

Some time ester Horace hed publlshcd his three books of Odee, end hed. es trappe-rs,
leid aeide thet sort oi writiug, it seems thet Maecenas, sud probebly hie other friends,
begged him to return to it Thet ie the obvious meeniug oi the remonstreuce with which
the Epietle opens. Hc expresses eu esrncst wish ιο retius into prirscy, ιο ubendou
poctry, eud ιο devote himself to the study oi philosophy. lle discleirm ull connexion with
secte. end professes in ull humility, but not without some irony, to follow his own aude
notione se s mere begiuner3 his hope end purpose, he esys, is ιο cen-y virtue into ectire
pnctice, ee thet which “Aeque paupe-ibus prodest, locupletibus eequc ;” he recommends
it ss the penecee oi lile, ss the only true wiedoru3 he looks upon the world es e shutllhg
scene ol inconsisteucy, end meu’e judgmeute se shullow end vulgum he ereu charges his
petron himself with the prevuiling lerity.

We msy inser from ell thie thet Horace, who lmew the world pretty well, end whose
llis hed not been fres from many veneticus, erleing out oi the jeuloueies hie populurity end
his writings hed occasioned, would heve been gled ιο rstire to hie books end his reflec-
tione, not, es some heve sold, to the etudy of philosophicsl systems, ior ull of whicbl
believe he hed e contempt iu his beart, ss he ceuuot help showing creu in hie short
summery et the end oi thie Epistle; the οιίοιοι oi hie sermon ou vinus is en irresistible
joke et the expense oi the Stoice, the most rigid though not the most praetiosi edwocms
oi virtue. Whetever viewe Horace hed iu respect ιο gooduese end hsppiueee were his
own: eud we cen believe thet oue who hed euch perceptione oi the iollies eud wioes οι
the world wee elucere iu wishing to get ewuy from it3 thst hewse tired of ereputstiou
which brought him into trouble; end thet he wse weery of writlng verses to express s
passion he neverhecrtily felt end wes still lese likely ιο feel in his sowy-fifth yecr. He
did return to ode uhtiug, ee we know, end wrote some oi hie best verses (but not hie
best love verses) long ulter ho hed plesded hie exemptiou with Msecenes. When this
Epistle wse written is not to bc trsced by euy incidentsl ullusions, eud we ceu only
suppose it wus eome time efter the publication oi the odes, which was not cerlier theu
s.o.c. 730. The year 734 ie assumed with some probability by Franks.
