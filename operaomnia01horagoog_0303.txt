EPODON LIBER, 2. 273

GARMEN ΙΙ.

Horace, meaning ιο write ou the praises cf the connmy, put his poem (whether as aa
aster-thought or not may he open ιο conjecture) into the shape of a rhapsody bya money·
getting usurer who, efter reoiting the blessinge cf ιι country life aud sighing for the enjoy-
ment of them, receiving tc throw up his business and persuading himself that he desires
nothing so much as retirement end a humble life, finds habit ιοο strong for him and falls
back upon the sordid pursuite which after ell ere most ccngeuial to him. Some may
perheps think that thie little bit cf satire is the chief object for which the poem was
written. My impreesicn is that it wae commenced whetherin imitation of virgil, Georg.
ii. 458, sqq„ ae lirenke supposes, cr of some poem cf Archilochon as lachmann, or not
in imitation cf any thing which is more probable) as a “laudatio vitae rusticae” (which ie
the tenor cf mostof the inscriptione), aad that the last four verses, which have been called
clumey, were added tc give the rest e moral. At any rate the greater part of the speech
must be admitted ιο be rather cut of keepiug with the supposed speaker. We should not
expect, for instance, tc hear a city usurer talk about an hereditary fam, the dengm cf
the soldier and the seilor, and the ceree cf lore. 'l'he last difficulty is got rid of by Doeriug
and others, who interpret ‘emor' (r. 37) ae the lose of money, which that editor says
‘⁶ rix dubitari potest,” though the word ‘habendi' “paulo licentius omisit.” Thia 1
am quite eure is wrong; and 1 think we must ellcw thet Horace was more intent upon
his description than oc maintaining an scemate ccnsieteacy between the drmmstances cf
the speaker and the sentimenta he utters. But, however this may be, the picture is very
beautiful and the moral very true. In the most sordid minds more genial impulsee will
sometimes adse: but the besuties of neture aud the charum cf a peaceful retirement are,
like virtue iteelf, only athactire in the dbtence and at intervals ιο minda that hare grown
addicted tc the parauit of gain fcr ite ownsake. Το such rainds domestic aad innocent
pieasuree citer no lasting gratificatiou, and the picture of rustic enjoymect on the one
hand, and of the jeded but still grespiug neurer struggling for a moment against his
propenslties oa the other, alfords ο wholesome lesscn for meny. la respecttc the date,

. it ceu only be conjectured that Horace had taeted the enjoymcnta he describes so graphi·

cally, and was in possession of bie farm. But eren thetis uncertain. anke, thinking
that Horace must have bad before him Virgil'e second Georgic (stt, sqq.), which some say
was not publisbed till e.n.c. 724, attributes this cde ιο 724 also, in which his friend
lachmann informs him he seems ‘¹ nimis subtiliter ignorabilia rimatus eese.” 'lbere is
a fragment from the camedy Nr'yacs attributed ιο Aristophanes (344, Dine), which ie
very like thir cde. Whetber Horace ever sa‘w it cr tbought of it when be wss writing it
is impossible tc say. lt runs thus :-

t μῶρε pcipe, ταῦτα πάντ’ ιν τῇδ’ ἔνι·
οἰκεῖν μιν ιν ἀγρῷ τοῦτον ιν τῷ γηδίῳ
ἀπαλλαγέντα τῶν κατ’ ἀγορὰν πραγμάτων,
κεκτημένον ζενγάριον οἰκεῖον βοοῖν.

ἔπειτ’ ἀκούειν προβατίων βληχωμένων
τρυγός τε φωνὴν εἰς λεκάνην ὠθουμένοις,
ὄψῳ ri χρῆσθαι autoritate rt soi κίχλαις
καὶμὴ περιμένειν tt ἀγορᾶς ἰχθύδια
spireio, πολοκιμητα, βεβασανισμινα

ἐπ’ ἰχθυοπώλου χειρὶ παρονοματάτο.
