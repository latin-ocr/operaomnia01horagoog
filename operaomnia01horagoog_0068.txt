38 HORATII FLAOOI

the espect of pnblic sffsirs drew forth this ode. 'lhe Scholissts ers st rerimee. Porphy- ,

rion, whom Lambinus follows, supposes Horace is sddressing himself to the fesrs of
Brutus, end dissusding him from renewing the botilo st Philippi, nster the deeth of
caetus-s strange time for writing verses siler the msnner of Aloeens, end un unnsusl
wey for s mihmry tribune to offer counsel ιο his commender·in-chief. Acron supposes
Horsoe ιο be alluding to the designs of the republican psrty, under Sextus Pompeius.
This opinion is supported st some length by Buttmsnn, Mythol. i. 3⁴³, sq., who urgues
thet the ship does not signify the commonweelth, for thet Horsoe spesks ss if he were
sepersted from the subiect of the silegorys thet ιο sdvise the citizens to sbstsin from
civil wsrs (represented by the ses) bemose they were in e crippled condition, would be to
imply thet they might engnge in them ifthey were not in thet condition ς slso thet thero
would be no propriety in representing the stete ss s dismmted ship in the time of Angus-
tus. He therefore considers thet eli this refers to the efforts of the broken but restiess psrty
to which Hortos hsd been letelysttechedto repsir their fertones under thelending of Sext.
Pompey. ¹ Nodum remigio lntns‚' he ssys, refers ιο the number of theirbest men cut
off stand sinos Philippi (he might heresdded the desertion of Menas). 'lhe ⁴ desiderium:
spoken of in ι. 18 mesns the lingering sffection end unxiety Horace hsd for the prrty he
hsd frrst esst in his fortunes with, end ‘inedium’ the rersfion he hsd mffmedin common
with Brutus end ull his best officere st the stete of the republiesn forces st Philippi.
‘Pontice pinns,' he considers s very mesterly chaslon to Pompey the Greet, ss the oon-
qneror of Mithridstes, which is Acron's opinion. 1 gire this theory in deferenoe to the
suthor, who hus few equms in criticsi ssgscity, end who in the esssy in which these riews
ere pnt forwerd hus done good service to the interpretetion of Horsoe on the principles
of common sense. 1 should mention however thst the theory hes bnt few supporters, of
whom Gesner certainly is one, snd his wss no mesu iudgment. Psssow is mother.
Frenke csnnot sufficiently express his astonishment st Buttmrnn’s shsnge doch-ine.
Huving mede up his mind thet none of the odes in these three books were written before
Actium, s.o.c. 723, he edopts the opinion of Torrentius, Messon, Smsdon, end others,
thet Horsce wrote this ode et the time when Αιιςιιιιιιι wns thinking of retiring from the
hesd of effuirs (ecc. 725), snd when he wss diunsded byhiseoenss ins speechin which
he likened the stete ιο s rossel tort upon the wsters without s pilot (Dion Coss. 52. lo).
It does not seem to here occurred ιο hsnke, thet supposing the historisn to hsre related
the sehrsl words of Maecena, which is somewhst improbeble, it is us likely he gothis
imnge hom Horace ss Horsce from him· But the imsge wss common enough md
elwsys will be, end it is es phin ss possible thst Herses got his notion not hom Msecenss
hut from Alceens. Besides the mntions eontsined in this ode sre plainly eddressed not to
Augustus hut ιο the citizens, end so fur hom requiring such οιιιιιὶοιιι they were importu-
uete in requesting him to remsin ss he wns.

Kirchner, who speeks of Buttmann's opinion ss ‘ infelicissime,' hss no hesitation in
referring the ode, with Epod. vii.. ιο the year before the bsttle of Actum, when the
firmes of wer were kindlingsgsin between Angustus end Antony. leni, Mitsch„ Docring
ere of the nme opinion, snd Dillenhr. rsther prefers it. Orelli is silent.

Hering now stated nli the opinions thet 1 here seen upon this much-disputed ode,
1 must leuve the render to jndge for himself. Thst there wns msny en honr when
Horsce sighed for pesce between the dsy he found himself estsbiished in his scribe's
office to thet which brought Augustus home in triumph is oertsin, end thet he felt es s
msn of weuk neres might feel in ιι ιιοιιιι during the troubles of thet long period msy
well be supposed. 1 think it is very hsrd ιο ssy ιι whst predse juncture in those stirring
times the notion entered his hesd of sitting dowu to write sn ode in close imitation of
Aioseus, though we may esfely affirm, thet the ides would only be nstnrsl while Rome wss
dhtnrbed, end therefore thet the ode wes written before the doeth of Μ. Antonius in eux.
724 01 the theories shore given I prefer Acron’s.
