'l'ha commentatore are much divided in their opinions as ιο ιιο person to whom this
ode is addresaed. The old inscriptions vary‚but in such a manner as ιο show that they
have ncne oi them any weight or authority. Torrentius mentions three MSS. which ara
headed “AdVirgilium Unguentarium urbis discriptio (the common blunder for ‘descriptio’)
Paraeuetice‚” and ιο himself adopts this absurdity, derived from v. 17. The Scholiast
Acron says, ‘⁶ sd Virgilium negociatorem scribit,'’ which is a mere assumption from tha
opening linas and v. 25, and when ιο interprete “ juvenum nobilium ” (v. ln) as Augustus,
crhiaecenas,ortlre step-scus ofAugustus, he shows he knew nothing of what ιο was writiug
about. li the question were ιο ιο decided by numbers, it would on ιιο whole be given in
favour cf Virgil the poet, and ιιο presumption is so much in favour ol that notion that
ιιο onus probandi lies 1 think with ιιοοο who deny it. Gesner says there is nothing in
the ode ιο indicata so warm afriendslrip as subsisted between Horace snd the poet Virgil.
But the odeis at best a trifle, andan invitation ιο dinner ls not the most inspiring subject.
When Virgil was going ιο sea, perhaps for his benith, Horace’s feeling for him was shown
strongly enough, which would be natural. Orelli and others object tc the expression
“ juvenum nobilium cliens,'’ as applied ιο Virgilius Maro. But,ifthe Scholiasta are agreed
that ‘juvenum ' may mean Augustus and Maecenas, they at least concede ιιο point that
‘ciens' may mean Virgil tha poet. Augustus is represented ss a ‘ juvenis’ in the second
cde of the first book, v. ll (where aaa note). Tha difficulty that arises out of v. 25, ‘pons
—etudium lucri,' Orelli himself disposes of when ιο says that it ia evidently ajolseg for,
though he also says that auch a johe lavellad at such a man would be very flat, this can
hardly ιο determined till wa know the point of it. We need not assum with Stephana
(Diatr. iv. p· 76) that Horace meanshy ‘studium lucri,' ‘mercaturam bonarum artium'
(Cic de on. iii 2), or the expectation of payment for his verses. If there be a jolse, virgil
understood it, whoever Virgil νιος but be ha who hc may we do not understand it, so
that nothing is gained by thia argument. 1 have not seen all that has been said upon the
subject, which has been discussed in separate trectises and in all commentarios, aud which
must always remain matter cf opinion founded upon very slender datar but my own
judgment is in favour cf suppoaing ιιο cde to be an early one addressed to P. Virgilius
Maro, the poet, not ιο “ soma relation or client ol hia‚'' nor to ‘⁴ tha grandson ol C. Ver·
gilius, tha praetor and friend of Cicero‚” nor ιο “a physician ol tha Nerones,” nor ιο a
trader, nor ιο a persumer. 'l'he pastoral lmages and description in ιιο three first stansas
have always appeared ιο me particularly suited ιο an cde addreased to Virgil the author of
