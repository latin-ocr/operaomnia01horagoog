PREFAGE. ix

have done my best to determine the date ol each poem ao iar aa
there are reasonable grounds to argue upon. The prinoipal antho-
rities on this subject now relied upon and referred to in this book
are Franks (Fasti Horatiani, Berlin, 1839) and Kirohner (Quaes-
tiones Horatianos, Leipzio‚ 1834). These two writers differ mato·
rially from one another, and both ol them hom Bentley, who in his
Preiaoe has leid down aseheme determining the dates of the seve·
ral books, without stating the grounds on whioh he sounds it. lt
will he seen that I prefer Franke's opinion on this subjeot to
Kirohner's, but that there are many instantes in whioh his real
appears to ‘outstrip his judgment in determining the date oi par·
tioular poema.

Ol the other books that I have used Ι have been most indebted
to Estre's Prosopographeia Horatiana (Amsterdam 1846), a most
favourable specimen ol industry and judgment.

Ι have studied with muoh pleasure the fragments oi the Greek
Lyrie poets, with whose entire works Horaoe must have been
familiar. 'l'he little that is leit may make us mourn for what is
lost. So much beauty has perished as the world will never see
again. There is mors power of tendemess and pessinunte feeling
in some oi Sappho's small fragments than in all that Horace
ever wrote. Suoh passages oi these poete as he appears to have
imitated, intentionally or otherwise, l have given, so far aa they
can ho gothered from the fragments now remaining, the edition of
whiehoyBergk(Leipzie‚1843)isthatwhieh1have uses. Most
oi them had οοοο quoted before.

This leads me to say that Ι have not loaded the notes with nearly

so many quotations as most who have gone heloro me. l have 0
tried to confine myseli to suoh passages as throw light upon tho
textor appear to have been imitated hy or eopied from Horace.
