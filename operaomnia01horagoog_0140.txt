CARMEN XII.

The Scholiast Acron ou Sat. ι. 2. ol hae collected from Horace inetancea of fictitioua
nemea put for real oneo of the same number of ayllablea of the rame quantity ς aa Licinia
(ao all the Scholiasta write the name) for Terentia Malthiuna for Maecenae inthe roth
verae of the above Satire; and Velliua for Annine in the ooth Bentley quotes Persius
(Sat. i. ι2ι)ε “ annectas asini Mida rex habet,” where Mida atanda for Nero. He

ode may be conjectured. Maecenas was married to Terentia about a.u.c. 721 or 722

not of long continuance: therefore it ia probable the ode war written acon atter the

triumph. That Augurum ia called Caesar (v. lo) acerna to Franke ιο make it probahle
