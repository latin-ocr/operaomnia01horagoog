no editor discharges his duty who does not take that course. The Ι

resrdt Ι have given, in each case, in the notes or introduction or
both; and in order to help the reader ιο form his own judgment,
1 have added, in such cases as admitted of it, the substance of each
poem in the form of an Argument. This serves the purpose of
giving a conspective view of the poem and its scope, and the con-
nexion of the different parts, and often supplies a word or sentence
which it otherwise might be necessary ιο translate in a note. The
Argumenta and Introductions will be found to relieve the notes
considerably.

Ι have done my best ιο determine the merita of the various
readings, and to choose in every disputed case the best, according
ιο my judgment. 1 have given in a note the amount of authority
for each disputed reading that I have adopted, and there is not a
word in the text which has not good MS. authority. “Lectiones
ex conjectura profectas tanquam pestem a contextu procul me
removisse dico¹.” To those who are accustomed ιο look upon
Bentley as a benefactor to the text of Horace, this statement will
not be aoeeptable. Ι have in no single instance adopted a con·
jecture of Bentley's or any body else's, nor have Ι proposed auy
myself. The antiquity, genuineness, and number of the MSS. of
Horace that have been collated by scholars of great respectability,
as well as the authority of the Scholiasts and quotations in early
writers, all combine to supply materiale for a more perfect text of
Horace than we ean get of almost any other writer. Opinions will
always differ as ιο the choice of readings, but ιο desert the MSS.
and resort to conjecture in the case of this author 1 bold ιο be
inexcusable. I bave not seen the smallest excuse for it in any
single instance, and with this opinion 1 can only look upon the
numerous conjectural readings of Bentley (nearly all of which Ι
bave referred to in the notes) as so many instances of false taste
