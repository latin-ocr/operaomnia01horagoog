376 HORATII FLAoel

mentesa days aiter Horace had leit mma The route they took was nottho sumes
or the easiest, which lay through Venusia and Tarentum. They preferred taking the
north-eastern road which strilres across the oounuy from Βιιιιιιιιιιιιιι, and, reaching the
coest st Barium, continues along the shore till it comes to Brundusium. They were
evidently not pressed ior time, aud probably took the rosd tbey did becauoe it passed
through Canusium, whither one oi the party was bound Maecenas made his Journey as
agreeable as under tbe circumstances it oould be, by taking with him such companionss
and they all appear to great advantage in Horaoe's good-humoured diary. 'lbere was no
restraint between the patron and bis friends, and their affection ior him and one another
it is very pleasant to contemplate.

Since ii the occasion above supposed be that on which the mission was sent, they could
not haue met Antonius at Brundusium, hbeir journey could not have ended mere:
Maecenas at least, and his official compauions, muat hare gone on to Tarentum. whether
Horace scoompanied them is uncertain. Ithiulr probably bs did not; but that Maecenas,
hearing that Antonius had coms tc Brundusium, and passed on to Tarentum, made all
haste to resch that place. I think it likely, however, that Horace took the oppor·
tuuity ol his return to Rome to visit his native town and its neighbourhood. Kircbnea’
(Qu. Hor. p. 89, sq.) thinks that it was on thia occasion he wrote theoda to Archyta
(i 28), and that to tbe muntain oi Bandusia (sii. 13); that he visited Septimius (C. ii. 6),
and renewed his acquaintance with Ofella (S. ii. 2). Probably Horace wolmero thau
one journsy to Tarentum, with which when he wrote his ode to Septimius he appears to
bave had very pleasant associatione. He seems to hare had in mind, as the Scholiasta
say, the description by Lucilius ci a journey hs took to Capua, ot which three or tour
verus only bave bean preserved (see note on ι. 6). >
