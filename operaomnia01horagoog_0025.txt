INTRODUOTION. xix

ol his Odes arc in nearly every instance fictitious I have no doubt what·
ever. Oinara⁵ seems to represent a real persam and with Canidia
some real intrigue and jaalousy no doubt are connected, whatever her
name may have been.

The same remark applica iu some measure to other Odes addressed
nominally to friends, but which might as easily be addressed to one
friend as to another. hbe difference is that the names are in most
instances known to be those of real persons, which has led many com·
mentators into inserences respecting the characters and circumstances
of those persons which 1 believe to be in most instauces imaginsry.

Ι have expressed my opinion of Horace as a Satirical writer in various
places. On this point the reader may reler to the remarks in the
Introduction to the ninth Satira of the first book. Ol common sensa
and a perception of the ridiculous; of that knowledge of mankind which
is gutbered by miring with the world; of dramatic skill; of good na-
ture and good breeding, Horace has shown sufficient procla, both in
the Satires and the Epistles. As a critic he is certainly defective.
Homer be does not appear to hare understood. Plautus and Terence
he could not appreciata, and the merita of Lucilius (and he must have
bad merita) would probably nerer bave been acknowledged or discovered
by Horace but for the feeling his criticism of that writer raised against
himself. He was of an indoleat habit, ot' which the unlinhhed state of some
of his pooms is one ol the effecta. “Amphora coepit Institni3 currente
rota cur urceus exit?” isaquestion that might be applied, Ι think, to
more than one ol bis Satires and Epistles. There is more inequality in
these than in the Odes; more also that is common-place in thought and
diction. The Odes will bear better than the Satires and Epistles the
close inspection that an editor is obliged to give them. Any one who
undertakes that office for Horace will find that one of his principal
difficulties consiste in the examinatior, first separately and then collec

tively, of so many small picturas as the Odes present. Thetendeucy of ·

commentatore to far-fetehed conjectures as to their scope, allusions,
date, dac, is very great, and the above difficulty partly accounts for it.
Their beauties and merita appear to me to be of a quiet kind, and
tho happy selection of words is one of them. Horacc’s selection of
apansa a judicans aaa foratae. “ Min a paene uanus Horatius
est in epithetis inveniendis ⁸.'' 'Phe tersencss and good senae of the
eayings which concern human life and character are as striking as
the manner in which they are introduced, being always in their place
and never brought in clumsily, as such sentences with less art might
easily appear. Her-ein, more than in any other mpect, Horace suc·
