'l'ism sre no internsl eridenoes‚ rt ull fit to be trusted, of the tirne when this poem
wes written or of the persone to whom it is sddressed. They ere three in number, ι
tutha end two sons. Porphyrion end Corum. Crnq. sey thot the iether is 1.. Cslprnnius
Piso Csesoninns, who wes Prsefectus Urbi under 'liberius (Tse. Ann. vi 10). lf thisbe so¹
es he wns born in n.u.c. 7⁰5, und hed nt this times son verging et leest on mnnbood (for
to no ouer nour un sorr or instruction ee numen ‘ee v. eoo), ue poem must rure
been written very shortly before the desth of llorece, eno. 74⁶. Orelli end Kirchnrr,
end msny others, taire this view of the dete. Estri, Frnnke, und mnny before them, put
it earlier, end in thst crue n different Piso must be ammei. The person supposed by
the edvooetes of un eerber dete is Cn. Calpurnius Piso, who belonged to the psrty of
Brutus end Canius, snd fought together with llorsoe st Philippi. lle hsd eson who ω
oonsnl unc. 747, nnd if he ω the youth referred to the Ars Poetics must bave been
written u good nisnyyenrs before. But the question is one it is impossible to deddc, end
nothing turns upon it for the understsnding of the poem, which, like meny others, might
be eddressed to sny body; though Ι do not sgree with those who suppose Horace hsd no
particular persons in mind. The Pisones ebore referred to ere nurnbered 8, 22, 2³, in
the Dict. Biog.

As to the purpose of the poeni lbere tried to help the render in judging for himself by
s csreful division of the Argument. It will be seen thnt the rules erc mnoeumeone, und
hsve little or no method, snd thet tbe history ol poetry which llorsoe given is more
fenciful thunrenl. Itisimpossible toloolnponit es nfiniuhedpoem. Wesreenrried
from precept to history, end from one sort of pcetry to snother without wsrning:
end though n genersl connexion msy be beced between the principles of one kind end
those of mother, no peins ure talen to seperate the rules thet belong to ench. 'l'he nules
end history of the Drerns ure chiefly dwelt upon, with whst perticulsr beering upon
Romen poetry it is not essy to see. Much thet is snid oen beve no reference to it et ull,
und eould ud'ord no instruction to s Romen. 'lbe'observstions on this subJ'ect urs inter·
rupted now end then by irrelerent observatione, end on the whole there esu be little
doubt either thet the Ars Poetics wss published efter Horsce's deeth, out of fragments
clumsily put together, or thst be published it himself in this careless wey from thet
hebitnel indolence which prevented bis ever producing n eomplete work ef eny length,
end which is seen in the ebruptness with which seversl of his pieces ure brought to n
close. Attempts heve been mede to re·errnnge the muteriels so ss to form u perfect
whole, bnt the reeens of doing so do not exist. The pisce now inverinbly resigned to the
Ars Poetios wns first given it by H. Stephens. ln the MSS. snd earlier editions itis
