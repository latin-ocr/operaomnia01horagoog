or ploce of executIon for slaves and others of ιιι lower sort, whose bodies were left nn-
buried for the dogs end vultures to prey upon (sce lipod. v. loo). Thia place, which
must always have ιιιιι a public nuisence and a source of melaria, was given (ns some say)
byadecreeoftheeensteto Maecenas, or elsepurehaeed byhim,cleared.drained,and
laid ont in gardens, ιιι which he asterwerde built a handsome house (see C. iii. 29. Epod.
ix., xiv. Introduction. S. ii. 3. 309). liis example was ιιιιιιιιιᾰι followed by a member
of the house of lamia, in whose gardens Caligula was buriad (Suet. Calig. e oe). Τιι
following Satira was suggested by e figure of Priapus set np in Maecenes' garden. Τιι
god is represented aa contrasting ιιι present stete of the ground with what it once was,
by which e complimentir conveyed to Maecenas for his public spirit in ridding the city of
ench enuissnce. Priapus is also mede to complain of the trouble he bas in keeping the
mund clear of trespassers‚ but more particularly of the witcbes, who, having formerly
carried on their practices among the tombs end bones of the dead, continued to haunt
the scene of their iniquity. This is introduced for the purpose of dragging in the woman
whom Horace satirized under the name of Gretidie 'l'he description isin some perte
very like that of the etth Epode‚ end ιιι two may have been written ebout ιιι same time.
It is not very likely Horace would have maintained his warfare with this woman, whoewer
ιιι war or whatever her oileum, for ιιιιιιι years. Kirehner (Qu. lior. p. lo), because
in S. ii. 3. 312 reference is made to Maecenas as engaged in building, plnces these two
Satires in consecutive years, thie being written ιιι. 721 (sec Introduction to Epod. w).
But there ιι not much in thia argument. ἰιι clearlng, draining, end encloaing of the
pouod must here taken sometime, end it may have been several years before it was ht
