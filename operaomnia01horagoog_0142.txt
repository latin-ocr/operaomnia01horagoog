112 HOItATII FLAOOI

Dices historiis proelia caesaris,

Maecenas, melius ductaque pervias
Regum colla minacium.

Me dulces dominae Musa Licymniae

Fulgentes oculos et bene mutuis
Fidum pectus amoribus ς

Quam nec ferre pedem dedecuit choris,

Nec certare joco nec dare brechia

Ludentem nitidis virginibus sacro
