CARMEN XI.

Supposing thot Inachis (v. o) were admitted ιο be the nme es the Insehis of the nert
ode (which is very doubtful, for the neme is fietitious, eud the person is most probebly
dotitious too), we should be nt liberty to ssy thet nt lesst two yenrs elnpsed between the
composition oi thet ode end thie3 bnt es neither eoutsius eny oertsin evidenoe of ite dete,
this somperlsou even then would be oi no velue for detes-mining when they were wn'tten.
Franks oompsres Set. ii. 3. 325, where Demesippus charges Horeoe with ‘⁴ Mille puellarum,
puerorum mille hirores,'' with his own excuse for writiug so little in this ode, ‘⁸ Amore,
qui me prseteromues expetit Mollibus in pueris eut iu puellis urere '’ (vv. ³, l); sud from
this infers they were written sbout the seme time. But the Setire oppeers ιο heve been
written et the eudoi nuo. 721³ whereiore he infers the lipode was written in thet year ς
which however is not very eonvincing. loen me nothing in the ode but o spedmeu of
thet spedesof composition to which lloreoe first hetoolr himself in imitation of the Greek
smetory writers. The metre is mtifieiel end diffiniit of sdsptetion ιο the latin lnngunge,
end the lust thet eny writer in thst lungusge would resort ιο for tbe expression of pusion,
though iu the Greek it is very expressive end tenda. Ido not believe therefore thet
this ode een be identified with eny precise period of Horeoe's life; ond ιο imegine him
deeply ln love with some young Lycisous is quite foreign ιο the view I telle of Horeoe's
love poems. The neme Lyciseusie probably formed from Lycus, Aloeeus’ fsvourite boy
(C. i. ³2. ll).

ARGUMENT.

Pettius, 1 sm so emitten with the heevy bend of love, who melles me sbove others his
vistim, thet l esnnot write es 1 used. 'Tis two yesrs sium Igsve up Inachis. Ah!
whet n byword wer 1 tbenl How l sigbed in eompeny end poured out my oomplnints
ιο thee when wine hed opeued my hesrtl ‘⁴ Hes the poor msu’s wit no chnuoe against
the riob msn's purse? My wreth is hindled ε 1 esst my modesty eud my sighs ιο the
wiuds; lwill oonteud with such rivels no more.” Thus did 1 boest3 but my feet
osrried me still to her eruel door. And now boesting thet Ι bove no women ιο feer,
Lyciscus hes oeught my besrt; nor osu oouusel or reillery deliver me, nor ought but
some new fleme.

annr, nihil me sieut entes juvet
Scribere versiculos amore percussum gravi,
Amore qui me praeter omnes expetit
Mollibus in pueris aut in puellis urere.
