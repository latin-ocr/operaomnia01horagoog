ιι HORATII FLAOOI

CARMEN XVII.

It msy entertain the resder to know that a treatise was cuca written on the subject of
Horaoe's Tyndaris, in which it was proved to the satisfacliou of the writer that she was
a freedwomen of Rhsemetalces, king cf Thrace, that she is ιιιι perscri Horace elsewhere
speaks cf ss Thressa chloe, Sidonia chloe, aud Venus Marina3 also that she was a
poetess. lt being assumed that tbe last cde was addresacd tc Tyndaris, according to the
common inscriptions, it' ιι supposed by many that the ιριιιι had made up their quarrel,
aud that Horace bere proposes a meeting ιο seal their reconciliatiou. Διι this which ιι
plainly unreasonable should be put aside by ιιι] who wish tc understand Horace There
is nc connexion between the two odes, except that the title, which belongs to this, has
been bcrrowed for tho other, and there is uo resson to suppose that Horace, writing at
his farm, had any other thsn an imaginary Tyndaris, with an imaginary Cyrus, in hia
mind. ·

ARGUMENT.

Tyndaris, often deth l’an leave Lycaeus tc visit Lucretile‚ prctscting my flocks stom
sun and wind; my goats go unharmed and fear not snake cr wolf when his street pipo
sounds in the vale ci Ustica. The gods love me for my piety and my muse. llere
Pleuty awsits thee; here shalt thou retine from the hcet and sing of tbe loves of Pena-
lope and Circe for Ulysses. Here thou sbalt quad mild lesbian in the abade, nor shall
strife be mingled with the cup, nor sbalt thou fear the jealous Cyrus, lest be lay bis
violent hand upon thee.

Vnnox amoenum saepe Lucretilem
Mutat Lycaeo Faunus et igneam
Defendit aestatem capellis
Usque meis pluviosque ventos.
Impune tutum per nemus arbutos
Quaerunt latentes et thyma deviae
Olentis uxores mariti,
Nec virides metuunt colubras
Nec Martiales Haediliae lupos,
