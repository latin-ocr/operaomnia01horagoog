346 HORATII FLAGOI

SATIRE III.

Hornce oppeers to hove brought enemiee upon himself by the lest Setire, ond perhaps
by others, which heve not been publiohed. llio nmiohle temper wos not very well qnali-
fied for thet sort of writing, end we moy lnior suom the precem poem thot he wished to
cleos himself from the imputetion ol s censorious spirit, ond so to set himself right with
Meecenes ond his friends. The connexion between the two Setis-esis seen in the opening
of this, in which Tigellino is ognin introduced ond the peculieritieo of his ὼιηοια· de·
scribed, ior no other resson us it would seem, bntto serve ns o text ior the dieoonroe
thot follows, on the duty of jndging others choritobly ns we wieh to he judged onr-
selves. ln the course oi his remarks on this subject Horace comes omnes two oi the
Sloic obenxditiese one thot ell inulte ere elike (v. ee, sqq.), which he meets hy the
Epicurean absurdity thot expediency ie the foundation oi right ς end the other thet every
wisc men (thetis, every Stolo) is endowed with eli the glsts oi ‘ert end somne hom the
slill of the mechonic to the power oi o king. Wrtbo jest upon this iolly the Sotire
oloses.

ihc chorocter oi Tigellius is beppily described (⁴⁴ Not ono, butoll meulsind’s epitome ”),
end e tone of good feeling runs throughout the Sotire. The lengnoge ie goniei, end
the sentimente omioble. The style is Horoce's own, os we moy suppose. 'rhet oi
Lucilius, it ie clenr, wne more estex the ieshion oi the second Sotire, io which hie
freedom of speech ond licentions lsngnege uppeer to me to be eimed ot without the
power which he possessed oi giving them point ond severity. No one who nendo thio
Setire would wish to see Horoce ln the diegnise of the other.

Ii there is between the two the connexion ebore snppomd, the third delire most heve
been written ot no greot &tenos of time oster the other. But it uppem from v. 63
thet he vos now well ncqnointed with Meecenns, though not on the terme oi inomey
which osterwerds grew up between them. On these munds it seems probohle thot the
Sotire wns written obont the end ot emo. 716, os Kirchner supposes.

ARGUMENT.

Singers hove ull one ieult-tbst they will never sing to their blondo when they ere eohed,
ond never leeve cll when they ere not. This ves the cose with ligelline, the most
inconsistent mon in the world. Censor himself could not induce him to sing onim
he chosc; when the fit ves on him he would keep it np hom the first course to the
deesext; one moment in n huny, onother obsurdly elow; now with 2⁰0 eleves, now
with bnt ten3 one while talking big, enother ull bumility3 one while content with o
little, snmhcr squnndering millions3 up ell night, snoring ull doy.

But whnt, heve yon ne isulte? Yes, but perhepo not so bod ns his. And yet 1 om
not like Maenius, who, while he exposed his neighbonr's fenim, ooolly declnred he
mode excuses sorbis own. Why should e men be blind to his own delecte end heve
on engle'o eye ior hie fellows'i He moy presently find them turning the tobles npon
him. Your friend we will soy lo n little hesty, end meritive, ond perhope not very
polished; buthe is s good mon, end kind to yon, ond e mon oi genius withnl. in
short, examine yonrseli‚ ond see wbet inulte notnre or neglect bu sown in yonr own
breeet before yon poss indgment on others.

het us think oi thie, how the lover overlooks or even loves the deformitiesof bis mistress.
So let ue err in friendsbip ond not be too fatidicum even os thesondiether findo
