SATIRARUM Ι. 8.

Hic dabat: Heredes monumentum ne sequeretur.

Nunc licet Esquiliis habitare salubribus atque
Aggere in aprico spatiari, quo modo tristes
Albis informem spectabant ossibus agrum;

Oum mihi non tantum furesque feraeque suetae
Hunc vexare locum curae sunt atque labori,
Quantum carminibus quae versant atque venenis
Humanos animos. Hos nullo perdere mesum

N eo prohibere modo, simul ac vaga luna decorum
Protulit os, quin ossa legant herbasque nocentes.
