OARMEN VII.

Munatius Pmncns, who followed dulim Ceeser bothin Geni sndin his ιιιι with Pompey,
efter Ceeser'r (leeth stteclsed himself to the repnhlicsn pcrty, bnt very soon esterwsms
J'oined Augustum then followed Antony to the esst, end nnnc. 722, the yenr before
Aetium, joined Augustus egnin. lt is supposed thet about this time, perheps etths
suggestori of Angustus, who ιιι sumens to secure Plancus end to keep him from
leeving luly, Herses wrote him this ode while his mind ιιιι perplered end he ιιιι per·
hsps mediteting retirement from Remoto Greeee.

1 think sll this is very doubtful, end with lintre (p. 308) 1 munet bnt think it uncer-
trin whether this Plsneus is intended st cll. lt msy hsve been his son, who is probshly
tle Munatius referre to in Epp. i. 3. 31, οι some other Plsncns. But eren if the iether
bs the men, Ι annot ιιι nny such ιιιίοιι purpose in the ode ιι the ebore theory
implies, nor do 1 believe Angustus meschec sny such velue to the renegsde'r ιιέιῑιιιοι.

Actium. 1 think the ιιιιιιι of Plsncus is sgrin used more ιι ι eonvenisnee then any thing
else, though there is perhsps ι little more individnslity given to this ode then the fourth.
Th0 story of Teucer hes cll the eppesrsnee of ι Greek origin.

ARGUMENT.

Iret others ring of the noble citios of Greeee, end dedicste their lires to the celebratior
of Athens snd cll its glories. For my pert Ιοιιι not for Ιιιοιάιιιιιοιι end larices,
ιι for Albuner's ιιιι, the hsnltr of Anio, end the weods end orchnrds of Tibur. The
sky ir not nlwsys durh, Phncus-drown esre in wine, whether in the csnrp οι in
the shedes of Tibur. Δι Teucer, though driven from his fsthsr's home, Ιιοιιιιιῑ
popter on his heed end choered his oompsnions, mying, ‘⁴ Iret ιιι follow fortune, my
friends, kinder then ι fsther: despair not while Tenoeris yonr chief 3 Apollo hes pro-
mised ns rnother Snlsmis: drown esre in wine, for to·morrow we will reeh the deep
