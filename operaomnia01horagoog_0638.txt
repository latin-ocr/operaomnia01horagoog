EPISTLE XII.
ιιι. 734.

locius, ιο whom this Epistls is sddressed, hss been mentioned, with sll nst is known
oi him, in the Introduction ιο C. i. 29, und Pompeius Grosphus in C. ii. 16. It is a
letter ol introduction ior Grosphus ιο locius, who wss employed in muusging Agripps's
estates in Sicily.

Ιι is possible Horsoe msy hove hsd s letter from locius in which he wrote something
thot give rise ιο the reflectione with which tho Epistle hogins3 hut to sdirm irom what
Horsoe here ssys thot Iooius wss s misor or s misanthrope, or ιιι] thing else but s good
sud sensible mon, ιιι] one who resds the Epistlo with the smsllsst attention must soe is
obsurd. The Argument will show the spirit of it, sud oonvinoe ιιι] body that ilonoo
monus nothing but oompliments to his friend.

The dite is not difficolt ιο mule out. 1t must hsve hoen written shortly oster the
suooesses oi Agrippa oguinst ihs Centobri, who, hsving been subdued by Augustus in
s.u.c. 730, siterwsrds broie out sgsin sud were finsllyoonquerod sud broken hy Agrippa
A.u.c. 734, in the autumn oi which year this Epistle wss written (See v. 29.) st flunt
time the close oi Tiberius’ expedition ιο Armenio, sud the restorstiou of the eundum oi
Crassus would be news just fresh.

ARGUMENT.

Use whut you get with disorellon, lcoius, sud no msn osu be better oli thsn you. Be
content. llo is nol poor who hus enough. holong ss you heve good heslth tho
riohes oi kings oould sdd nothing to your happiness. Aomstom yoursell' to simple
‘iuro sud you will never lesse it oll', though you should bo turned iulo gold, whedrer it
be thst money meles no ohsnge in our nutrires, or beususe, lslro s wise mun, you oount
every thing less than virtue. We moy wonder why Democritus should hsre negleoted
his goods ιο shsorh himself iu his studies, when we see how you uro oble in the midst
oi sordid employments to lio your thoughts ιο the skiss, sud ιο ssuroh into the springs
oi usture, und ιο bslsnoe rivsl sysiems.

But be ull this ss it msy, l beg you ιο receive Pompeius Grosphus, ond whatever he mks
let him hove, ior he will ssk nothing thst is not right. Such friends uro ohesply
purchased. ’

ll you would lmow whst is going ou st Rome, tho Csulsbrisn lms fullon before the vslour
oi Agrippa, the Armenion oi Tiberius. Phrsstes hus done homage sud sooepted the
yolse oi Csessr. Plenty is showering su shundsnt hnrrest upon ltuly.
